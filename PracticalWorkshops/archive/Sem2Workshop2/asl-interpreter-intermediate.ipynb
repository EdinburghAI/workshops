    "\n",
    "Sweet! Well our solution 1 seems to work incredibly well. Let's try out solution 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Solution 2 is _significantly_ more computationally expensive. I'd _highly_ recommend you pop on the GPU's if you want it to finish training for this workshop lol. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for the first solution, we only used ~1/3 of the data available, and we _still_ performed really well. Now, in order for solution 2 to do even half-way decent, we need *all* the data. This will take longer to prepare.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preparing The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from GPUs, we also need to change the images slightly so they'll fit into our CNN. For a refresher on CNNs, check out our [semester 1 workshop](https://github.com/EdinburghAI/workshops/blob/main/Sem1Workshop3/CNNs-Solved.ipynb) on them! _TLDR: They're neural networks that're specialised for images._\n",
    "\n",
    "How're we going to standardise the data? We'll need to turn their colours to be between 0 and 1 (where each RGB is currently between 0-255). We'll also need to resize their pixels to be 128x128. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why for both? Well we're going to be feeding each pixel into the network. The model will perform better if the values are normalised to be between 0 and 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "And why resize to 128x128? Kind of arbitrary, but it's a smaller size (which allows it to train faster as there's less calculations). Also, the square shape makes the model architecture simpler. "
