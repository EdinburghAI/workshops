Hey! We're [EdinburghAI](https://edinburghai.org).

This is the repo for our yearly workshops. These workshops are designed for beginners who have done some high-school level maths/programming before but not any machine learning. They are normally completed after a short lecture presented at the start of each workshop but they contain all the explanations required so can be completed independently of the workshops. 

The purpose of each workshop is for students to gain an intuition for why and how machine learning works (or doesn't...). Hopefully you'll be inspired to learn more, or to go and build something cool! 

Each workshop is a Python notebook. There are 4 which cover:

1. Introduction to Machine Learning
2. Neural Networks
3. Computer Vision
4. Natural Langauge Processing

For more details, check out the relevant notebook in a sub-folder.
