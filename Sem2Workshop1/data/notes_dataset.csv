### What?
It's a [[Dynamic Programming|dynamic programming algorithm]] to convert any [[Context-Free Language|Context Free Language sentence]] into a parse (syntax, parse) tree. It works on exclusively [[Chomsky Normal Form]]. 
### How Does it Work?
1. First, ***split up your sentence*** into a table as below. Split your sentence up with $(i,j)$ coordinates, with $i\le j$. Each valid coordinate is a substring of that sentence
![[Pasted image 20240207142114.png|500]]
2. You will work diagonally downwards, before filling up as much as the remaining column above you as you can, before moving diagonally down again. 
3. At each step you will see what your current substring can be made out of, using the culmination of the already solved substrings
4. Take (0,1). That's a $Det$
5. Now move onto (1,2). That's a $Adv$
6. Now move onto $(0,2)$. For **""my very""**, *nothing can be made* up of a $Det$ and a $Adv$.
7. Continue downwards and upwards until you get the top right. If it's a valid start, then you have a valid sentence. 
8. ***Note:*** Each layer you went up and across you had to consider all the possible new substrings."

> [!hint] Time Capsule Essay
> I wrote this essay in just under 2 days. I'd been thinking a lot about what the future would look like with [[AI|generative AI]] and [[Virtual Reality|mixed reality]] when they'd matured. I wanted to document exactly what I thought in a verifiably dated format, so I wrote and published it to [[Github]]. You can find the original article [here]().
## The Future?

On the 23rd of August, 2023, I predicted what a day in my life in 2030 looked like. I wanted to write a time-capsule, capturing our expectations of the future, in a verifiably dated form. It looks like this. 

I hope you enjoy.

# Edinburgh, 26/08/2030:

_Ding!_ I looked up and saw the “seatbelts” sign, now brightly illuminated. The bell’s _ding_ barely pierced the slow melodic drum of the airplane’s engines. My eyes were irresistibly pulled to the view beyond the 737's quaint windows, Edinburgh’s landscape unfolding rapidly before me. As it morphed from greenery to roads to runway, I couldn’t help but reminisce about my student days here, taking this exact flight every three months. It occurred to me that my first visit to Edinburgh was over a decade ago. The familiar landscape masked a new world, one technologically redefined. 

I was wrenched out of my daze by the twenty-something next to me. Her fists clenched on the armrests on either side of her, betraying her unease with flying. With each turbulent thrust of wind, her stomach dropped lower and lower. But most intriguing to me was the pair of ski-goggles-esque headset that adorned her face. I recognised them instantly as Apple’s latest _Visions_, an XR headset that allowed her to seamlessly mix between the real and virtual world. Her pair was even customised to match her outfit. 

Clearly a fashionable Gen-Z, her headset showed she was _“engaged”_. An animation of blue and purple waves of light, akin to the Aurora Borealis, danced atop her goggles. The “engaged” animation implied she was in full _Virtual Reality_, completely shut off from the real world. I wondered where she was virtually at that exact moment. 

Gaining inspiration from the animation, I imagined she was in a peaceful arctic retreat, gazing at the beautiful spectral show of the Northern Lights. I realised it was a lot more peaceful than being in a flying tube of metal hurtling towards the ground at a concerning velocity. 

But no virtual trickery could disguise the lurching of the plane as its tyres landed - pummelled - onto the runway. No matter how technologically advanced our society became, I knew a turbulent RyanAir landing was something I could rely on. 

My attention was drawn back to the girl. She’d switched back to “_Present_” mode, as I now saw her eyes through the goggles. With the ability to now interact with the real world, she reached for her bags, pausing momentarily, eyes dancing around the screen. She was probably catching up on all of the notifications she’d received while flying. My theory was all but confirmed when I saw her thumbs methodically tap specific fingers - the modern way of “clicking” for these goggles. 

While passengers began to disembark, my mind wandered back to the girl beside me, speculating just how profound her aversion to flying might be. These XR headsets are notoriously unreliable on planes or cars, but if she was willing to use them regardless, her situation must have been quite dire. Wow. Flying must have been extremely difficult for her before this technology. 


---

As I exited the airport, I popped on my own pair of Visions and called an Uber. _“Driven or Autonomous?”_ a prompt asked me. It only then dawned on me that the Lothian Council had granted permission for self-driving vehicles to roam specific streets the month prior, a full year after my first autonomous experience in London. Wanting to play my own music, I selected Autonomous. 

As I waited on the bench for my ride into town, I switched my Visions to “Engaged” mode and replayed the _Lakers-Bulls_ basketball game that happened just the night before. As last night’s _experience_ loaded up, I was completely and suddenly transported to the United Center Basketball Stadium, any traces of Edinburgh erased. I sat courtside, with celebrities sitting next to me, all cheering at each shot, rebound and block. Animated fireworks exploded above me after each three-pointer. A floating scoreboard danced in my peripheral, coming into focus with a single glance. The sound of the squeaking sneakers or cheering supporters around me only helped me further immerse myself in this world. 

As technologically impressive as it was, I still knew the result of the game. The Bulls were on their league-winning streak. This game was no different. It was a nice change of pace to them only a couple of years back, when they struggled to gain any notoriety at all. Because of the game’s unsurprising nature, I whipped up a single 2D screen playing Sunday’s F1 race to the corner of my eye. Ironically, it gave me joy to see Redbull, a once outrageously dominant team, struggle to break P5. Just as McLaren crossed the finish line, the real world faded back into view. It was my Visions alerting me that my Uber had arrived, with a convenient green waypoint indicating which of the many Toyota Priuses was for me. As I entered, my Visions authenticated with the empty vehicle, ensuring I was the correct passenger for the transport.

Almost instantly, my Visions wirelessly connected as a guest to the car’s modern Apple CarPlay system. _The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill_ began playing, but I quickly dug through my Spotify and resumed _BBC Radio 4(U)_ on my ride into town. 

Presenters Emil and Vicky bantered about how they spent their weekend. Emil began a long winded rant about how he tried for hours to get some money from some class-action lawsuit, only to end up getting £2. Vicky, with her soft Cardiff accent, began cackling up at this. A bit more light banter ensued before they mentioned they were going to continue the music with a throwback to the mid-2010s. As the sound of drums began to play, I couldn’t help but crack a smile. My favourite song at the time, _Love Is Only a Feeling_ by _Joey Bada\$\$_, began playing. Of course, this was no mistake. 

_BBC Radio 4(U)_ was a custom radio station I created on Spotify, shaped to my tastes and whims. The presenters, Emil and Vicky, were two AI radio hosts I modeled off of their real-life _BBC Radio 1_ counterparts. Fortunately for me, real-life Emil and Vicky opted to make their voices and mannerisms free for public use. This meant I could listen to a radio show with charismatic hosts who played the exact music I enjoyed. These AI hosts spoke the perfect amount (according to my taste anyway), cracked jokes and always spoke about things that were relevant to me, whether I knew it or not. It was like magic, save for their occasional hiccup in the AI-infused humour. This was especially notable when the tones of voice didn’t line up with the punchline, but it was a small price to pay for music I always enjoyed. 

I rummaged through my bag for my iPhone 20. I used my Visions more often, but I occasionally enjoyed the more tactile experience of typing on glass. Also, I was about to catch up with _Pi_ and the experience was hit or miss when there were no microphones nearby. 

Like a lot of people my age, I had an AI personal assistant. But while many renamed theirs, I kept the default name; Pi. According to its creator, an AI studio called _Inflection_, Pi stands for Personal Intelligence. I customised everything else about it so that it could serve me the best possible use, but I always opted away from changing its name. I thought it would be the final barrier I broke down before completely anthropomorphising one of the _things_ I spoke to so often. 

“Pi are you there?” I called out.

“Hey Leo.” a South Dublin voice, distinctly feminine, responded gently. “How can I help you?”

“Catch me up would you please”

“Sure thing. Your colleague Andrej scheduled a meeting for today at 2 p.m. I know you’re on PTO, but he mentioned in the invite it’s about trialing a new product. I know you enjoy those trials, so I haven’t responded to the virtual meeting invite yet. Would you like to go?”

“I’d love to. Book a nearby co-working space with a separate meeting room that I can take the meeting in. If it’s less than a twenty-minute walk away, don’t bother booking a taxi there.”

“Great. I’ll get on that” she asserted. “Also, Google is settling a class action lawsuit with the citizens of the EU under the EU Ai Act for how they trained LLMs on user data. I’ve scanned the details of the case, and you’re eligible for some compensation. I can't guarantee it’ll be much, but I can get it sorted. Do I have your consent to provide your banking details to exclusively the relevant parties so that you can get paid?”

“I, Leo Camacho, give you consent to share my banking details.” I asserted. I always found it amusing how professional you had to be with Pi when it came to data sharing. She wouldn’t accept a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’. “Anything else?” I continued. 

“Yes. Last thing. I saw on your _FindMy_ that your sister is up from Manchester in Newcastle. With the new LNER train in operation, her journey up from Newcastle to Edinburgh would only be thirty minutes. Do you want to arrange to do something with her? Keep in mind you're meeting Tom and Gregor at 8 pm.”

“That’s a great idea Pi. Change your settings to encourage me to focus on meeting my friends and family more often by making more offers like those. Now send the following voice message transcript to Manny: ‘Hey sis. Saw you were back up in Newcastle for the week. Want to come up to Edinburgh for some dinner? The new LNER train is finally up and you’d legit only take thirty mins getting here. If you’re down let me know and I’ll get Pi to book your tickets and reserve a table.’”.
 
“No worries Leo. Also, while we were talking I sent a _reflection_ of myself to talk to Google’s Legal Ai. You were entitled to £50. I took 20% commission and deposited the rest into your account. Also, I spoke with the AI of _The Melting Pot_, a local co-working space, and you’re booked in for 2-2:30. The transcripts of both conversations have been sent into your inbox.”

“That’s perfect. Thanks Pi.”. I quickly scanned over the conversations Pi had with the AIs but found nothing of interest. I chuckled at how Pi actually tried arguing I was entitled to £75 to Google’s Legal AI, but to no avail. 

This was one of my favourite features of modern-day chatbot assistants: their ability to talk to other AI assistants and their accountability in doing so. My Pi was able to send a copy of itself, with my interests in mind, to talk to (Ai or not) representatives of companies. It could report back to me with its findings, with its conversation cryptographically recorded and signed. This was the single feature that made me feel most like I was living in the future. Of course, it wasn’t perfect. Not all businesses had an AI representative Pi could converse with. Some that did severely limited the abilities it had to simple information providing. That meant that no matter how capable your Pi was, you’d have to manually go onto the web to do what you were looking to do. But because Pi, and other similar AIs, prioritised businesses it could talk to, there was tremendous economic incentive for local businesses to develop an AI. But since that was an expensive endeavour, OpenAi, Inflection and many other AI studios sold just that feature…

Regardless, I appreciated the £40 for doing nothing. It once again became clear to me that Pi was the single best investment I could make. Pi costs me about £50 a month (the price varies based on usage), but between the money she earns me and the time she saves me, she’s easily paid herself off multiple times over. Once again, it shocked me that Pi, or Ai’s like her, were still more unpopular than popular despite the immense use they served.

A prerecorded voice rang out through the Uber letting me know I arrived at my location. As I exited the car onto Prince’s Street, my stomach dropped when I realised what I’d walked into. Edinburgh Fringe 2030, the largest arts festival in the world, had returned for its yearly occurrence, the thick swathes of tourists along with it. I moved to London in July 2026, so this was my first Fringe in over five years. I made a mental note to ask Manny if she’d like to watch a show, just like how we did at my first-ever Fringe. Grimacing, I began my journey through the swarms of crowds to my accommodation for the week; my mate Gregor’s flat.

A brisk 15-minute walk later, I arrived at Gregor’s flat. I let myself in using an old-school combination lockbox attached to the wall. Climbing the stairs I saw a large white and red box, riddled with cables, hanging on the wall. Curious, I inspected it closer. Of course. The iconic Tesla logo told me everything I needed to know. It was the building’s communal battery. Gregor’s building was a part of the new Net-0-Carbon initiative, which meant it utilised not only hyper-efficient solar panels and bladeless wind turbines but also could sell excess electricity back to the grid. This technology has existed for years now, but such green initiatives are becoming more and more common in cities due to aggressive legislation from the UK government. 

“Neat” I murmured before climbing the rest of the way. 


---

“Gregor?” I called out into the flat. No response. He didn’t share his location with me, but I presumed he was at work. Starving and looking for some time to kill, I decided to cook a new dish I’d never cooked before. I scanned the HelloFresh app for ideas and landed on a timballo. After a quick trip to the Sainsbury’s downstairs, I was ready. Bar the fact that I had no idea how to cook a timballo. 

Naturally, I adorned my headset and asked a HelloFresh bot for some tips for the process. As I boiled the eggs, I hastily threw up some timers and instructional videos, pinned to my peripheral. I’d already begun boiling the eggs when I saw how long this was actually going to take. One of the things the bot failed to mention was that this was a three-hour affair… 

An arduous journey, and three hours later, I had produced a timballo, thanks to a constant baking “buddy” next to me. I was appreciative of this new technology. I was never the greatest chef, but I was proud of the meal I’d made myself. A meal I would never have tackled without the help of a pro (human or robot) next to me. 

I sat down to enjoy my lunch before a news alert came on screen. I watched, uninterested, as a representative of the council alerted me that as it was the Fringe’s busiest week, many roads would be closed down, buses’ timetables altered and diversions implemented. The diverted routes only marginally affected my plans, but regardless I scanned the alert for a cryptographic signature indicating it was a legitimate post, something I learned was crucial to do. 

A year prior I saw a _BBC News_ report with Rishi Sunak where he declared the City of London was removing Uber’s Autonomous license. Sensing impending financial danger for the ridesharing company, I hurriedly sold half of my Uber stocks at a (marginal) loss. I only realised the day after that the video was a deepfake, designed to send Uber’s stock price to the floor. The video was indistinguishable from a legitimate report, with the PM’s voice and mannerisms a perfect replica. The only thing it was missing was the cryptographic signature indicating it was real. In a rush to sell my stocks, I missed the single glaring red flag there was. 

I finished my lunch, put the rest in the fridge (with a sticky note saying “Eat away!”) and made my way to the co-working space. With ample time to make it, I decided to take a detour through George Square, my old University campus. 


---

Immediately, I was shocked by how little it had changed. Granted, temporary buildings had been erected for Fringe, but the University architecture still had its old charm to it. Post-grads still roamed the campus with a sense of impending deadlines (read: impending doom). Undergraduates wouldn’t return for another few weeks, but the campus didn’t need them to have the characteristic hustle and bustle to it. Despite countless technological advances since my time here, it was strikingly unchanged. 

There were some subtle contrasts to when I was a student. As I looked at the students individually, I could see some were discussing their dissertations with their supervisors, while others were having their ideas and theories challenged by some AI educators. I’d have loved to have seen my old lecturers as bots. What I would’ve given to have had the tools these students have during my first year at University.  

I made the regrettable mistake of wearing my Visions as I passed a Tesco on my walk. Almost instantly, personalised offers began popping up around me. Floating banners exclaimed that I could get a _meal deal for £3.50!_ An echo from my past reverberated in my skull, back to when I almost lived off of those meal deals. I just ate and wasn’t hungry, but the ad was incredibly enticing.

The shove of a stranger took me out of my hypnotic trance. Frustrated at what had just happened, I turned off my headset and rested it around my neck. The bombardment of ads almost made me buy the last thing I needed right now. Irked, I moved on. 

I arrived at the coworking space with 10 minutes to spare. A bright red door lay wide open, held there by a door stopper in the shape of a small dog. Within it, a pair of closed sliding glass doors. I looked around, confused, and saw a badge reader icon. I tapped my iPhone’s “identity card” to the reader, which was pleasantly accepted with a satisfactory _ding_. Like magic, the doors slid open. 

Unsurprisingly, The Melting Pot was a typical co-working space. The walls were brightly painted, illuminated by a staggeringly large skylight. Surprisingly, the colours worked well together. The furniture was gratuitously oversized and there was greenery at every possible turn. It had an unmistakable buzz to it as employees of countless different companies all worked, tapping expeditiously on their keyboards. I scanned past the common desks for the meeting rooms. I was happy to see The Melting Pot had a _3D meeting room_, which allowed me to meet with my colleagues in London and San Francisco as avatars, not as a simple 2D projection. I plugged my MacBook into the wall and adorned my Visions. I swapped out the interchangeable battery with a fully charged one and prayed it would last me the whole meeting. Apple Visions were many things. Long-lasting was not one. 

“Hey Pi, catch me up for this meeting” I asked. As Pi recounted details and information I might find useful for this tech demo, I silently whispered gratitude at my current position. I was an engineer working on Alignment at OpenAi London. The general public conceded that _Artificial General Intelligence_, AI systems that are generally smarter than humans, was only a matter of years away. My job was helping ensure these models behaved in a way aligned with human intentions and values. I knew I was doing important work. Not to mention, I loved it. 

As the virtual meeting space loaded up in my Visions, I saw a semi-realistic 3D rendering of Ilya Sutskever, the co-lead of Super Alignment at OpenAi. Basically, the main guy in charge of ensuring these models don’t end up hating us. He began speaking and I wondered if he was speaking English or Russian. His English was near perfect, but I knew his Russian came more naturally. I, of course, wouldn’t be able to tell, as Microsoft Teams’ new auto-translate feature automatically converted each other’s speech into the language most suitable to the listener. Not to mention, it would do it with our voices. Curious, I went to ask Pi but realised she was disabled for the meeting. The meeting contained proprietary technology, and so by policy, we weren’t allowed third party bots present.

As the meeting concluded, I walked away with a grin on my face. The technology we trialed was the culmination of my 6 months working there at OpenAi so far. We developed a system that allowed GPT-7 to iteratively supervise more complex models while giving us confidence it remained aligned. 

I left The Melting Pot and walked towards Bristo Square to go see my sister. The walk, a solid 20 minutes in length, flew by as I reminisced on all the good times I had in each passing location. I was knocked out of my nostalgia when I saw a familiar face sitting on the steps of the square. My sister sat on a decorated bench, a book in hand, admiring the tipsy tourists ordering another round of pints in the sun. I ran up to her and gave her a bear hug. It had been almost 6 months since I last saw my sister in the real world. We virtually chatted frequently, but it wasn’t the same. As we caught up, I mentioned we should go see a show. 

“Yeh absolutely let’s do that” she agreed. “But nothing with chatbots or where we need our Visions. They’re kinda crap”. Quite frankly, I agreed. Some Fringe shows heavily involved the use of technology. Some had interactive virtual features that could only be accessed with a pair of Visions or similar headsets. Other ‘One Man Shows’ actually had Ai voices serving as co-stars. I’d watched recordings of both of them on YouTube and clips on TikTok and just considered them too gimmicky to be worth it. 

“Sounds like a plan sis. Ready for some food? I’m starving.”

“Let’s go” she replied. As we walked into our favourite Mexican joint, El Cartel, where lively chatter and sounds of laughter reverberated, I powered off both my Visions and iPhone. Sometimes, it was better to disconnect from all of the technology around us and just be present. 

_Leo, 23/08/23_


# Analysis:

The story you just read featured technology I (optimistically) expect to be available in 2030. 

First, some background. These predictions, and in turn the story, were heavily influenced by two enormous technological advances that happened only in the last year; Apple’s Vision Pros and Generative AI. If you asked me to write this essay a year ago, I would have had a wildly different imagined world. I’ll not find out if it would have been more or less accurate for a while now…


## Apple Vision Pros:

One of the main features of the story was Apple’s Vision Pros. They’re the combination of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) headsets, with a dial to switch from the augmented real world (imagine you’re in the real world with a YouTube video in your peripheral) to a fully virtual one (where the Youtube video is now playing like a cinema and all around you could be the arctic).

I don’t imagine them to be wildly different from the product they first announced only 3 months ago (a 3D AI-generated image is available in the repo of what I expect them to look like in the future). The difference is I expect them to be wildly more popular by 2030. By then, I expect the headset, and similar headsets, to be where the iPhone was in 2012. Society was only halfway through the transition from actual caller phones (think BlackBerrys) to smartphones. In the same way, most people will still be opting for their iPhone for most use cases in 2030. 

But the early adopters (like myself in 2030) and the early majority will utilise the headset for what it’s capable of. I’ve long believed this technology was the future (thanks to Ready Player One), but seeing one of the tech giants throw their glove in the ring only further solidified my belief. 

Thanks to the vibrant developer community that Apple has developed, there will be countless developers looking to port their apps onto the headset. It’s not clear to me yet whether or not the apps will be a glorified way of watching content or whether the devices will actually be able to interact with the world. Ever a tech optimist, I predicted it would be able to do both, and it’s up to us to choose how we use it. Be it practical (the Uber app interacting with the world and highlighting which car was mine), purely entertainment (the basketball game) or a healthy mix (the instructional cooking videos and timer as I made the food). Ultimately, this will be up to Apple and the developers to decide what’s possible with these devices. I hope by 2030 they’re an actual tool (like how phones are) and not just glorified content consumption devices. 


## Generative Ai:

Generative AI has been around for a while. The suggested word feature above our keyboards on iPhones? Been around since 2014. But the mainstream only appreciated its value when, in November of 2022, ChatGPT rose to prominence. With a simple chat interface, _anyone_ of _any profession_ and _any skill_ could ask a computer _anything_ and it would respond _well enough_. 

For technical reasons, I won’t get into the why here (check _GPT - The Nerdy Details_ page), but by 2030, virtually every small and big platform alike will be **_able to efficiently and immediately generate high-quality content of all types, relevant to anyone or any query_**. The importance of this cannot be understated. 

What does that mean? 


#### For businesses: 

In 2023, most businesses involve operations where a human takes an _input_ and _generates_ a response _relevant_ to the details of the business. This could be a human taking in emails and _generating_ a response _relevant_ to the details of the business. Or the ads manager taking the store’s broad demographic information, _generating_ and delivering ads _relevant_ to the _mass_. 

Generative AI is set to supercharge businesses’ ability to create content, down to the individual level. For example, a store could utilise Generative AI to respond to individual customers’ emails, _relevant_ to the exact customer’s needs and the store’s details. Alternatively, it could deploy a bot, designed to answer customers’ individual queries or even perform basic actions on behalf of the business (E.G book a table). Or it could deliver custom ads to individual consumers, relevant to the specific purchases we’ve made in the past. In short, Generative AI will help businesses dramatically enhance their ability to connect with individual consumers.


#### For consumers:

Generative AI for consumers is what I’m most excited for in the future. The possibilities really are endless here. Much of the generative technology I documented exists today. 


##### Content Generation:

You can generate a conversation between two robots (with GPT-3.5, Bard, Llama 2, Claude 2…) and have a speech synthesiser read it out to you (Speechify, Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, ElevenLabs…). You can even have an (unrealistic) 3D avatar say those words (DeepBrain Ai)! The problem? The tech today just isn’t that good. Or it’s too expensive and difficult to make for it to become mainstream. But what’s to stop someone combining all these technologies when it becomes cheap enough (before getting bought out by Spotify of course)?


##### Chatbots:

Again, chatbots have been around for a long time. Recently, they’ve been supercharged by utilising a new type of algorithm called _The Transformer_ (Check _GPT - The Nerdy Details_ again). While they’re incredibly advanced today (_GPT-4_ helped me write this essay - check out our conversation in the repo), we’ve only scratched the surface of what’s possible with these technologies. For them to serve as much utility as I described in the story, we need two things; first, a common framework that allows chatbots to interact with the world. The second thing is to concede inconceivable amounts of personal data to these companies. 

The first problem is that of a technical one. How would a future version of Pi book a local coworking space, train tickets or a table for dinner? I believe companies like WeWork, TrainLine or OpenTable will develop plugins that give major chatbots the ability to interact with their services (in a similar way that OpenAI has a plugin store). A standard may even arise over how to code these plugins. 

The second one is more of a societal problem. Data. 


### Data - The Caveat:

Generative AI will only get more and more capable. But for it to become more useful, it has to be more personalised to us. That means feeding it information and data about us so that it can produce the most relevant content. 

Companies (like Tesco) are salivating at the opportunity that’s opening up in front of them. Tesco already collects all the information about what you buy and how often you buy it (you think a Clubcard is just so that you can get good deals?). Soon, they’ll be able to deliver ads specialised to every individual, enticing them with what they’re most likely to want at that moment. 

Imagine a _H&M_ ad delivered to your feed, that goes: “Remember that green jacket you loved? It looks great. You’ll absolutely love this matching jumper. But quick! There’s only a few left in stock in your size. Click here to generate a photo of you wearing it!”. 

While the technology will be ready far earlier than late 2030, it’ll be a question of whether or not we’re societally ready for it, from a privacy and ethical point of view. 

And what about the consumer? A big part of this story was my AI personal assistant, Pi. It works so well because, like all good PAs, it knows an incredible amount about me. In the story alone:



* It knew details about my work, my calendar, meeting notes, and the sort of work I enjoy most
* It knew my sister’s default location (i.e. home) based on _my_ FindMy
* It knew I was a Google customer for years
* It knew my location 24/7, contacts, and countless other micro-nuances.

Needless to say, the information we’re set to give up in the future makes the Google or Cambridge Analytica of today look like child’s play. But do the ends justify the means? I (in the story) clearly find value in giving up my data for a personal assistant. I even pay for the privilege. Currently (2023 Leo speaking), I’m okay trading all that information for an assistant who can do what Pi does.

Of course, while it will be technologically possible, we could never get to that future because of privacy advocates like Apple (the outlier in Silicon Valley). Apple has long championed privacy-centric products (They made sharing the _IFDA_ [a unique code that merchants used to track consumers across apps] optional, against huge backlash from data scrapers including Facebook). Seen as they’re the hardware basis for much of the technology, they could prevent it. That said, I can see entire services popping up designed to allow you to get the most out of your assistant. 


## Other Tech Advances:

The rest of the story contains snippets of where I perceive other technologies to be by 2030. 


#### Autonomous Vehicles:

In the story, I take a ride into town in an autonomous vehicle. I think autonomous vehicles are a deceptively challenging problem. We’ve been promised self-driving cars for _years_ now. But Waymo and Cruise are both actively expanding out of Silicon Valley _today_. If this progress continues, it makes sense major metropolitan areas will see an influx in those sorts of rides. The challenge for those companies will come when expanding into rural areas with less well-defined roads. 


#### Green Initiatives:

The entire world is “racing” towards a greener future. Some countries are faster than others, of course. The UK has banned the sale of diesel cars by 2030 and is actively pushing forward other green initiatives. With the lowering costs of batteries, we could see more incentives to produce clean energy, store it and sell it back to the grid when it’s not needed. This is a technology that’s actively in use today, but it’s typically reserved for houses with lots of wind or sunlight. Government incentives could help push the agenda further afield. Or maybe (read: hopefully), the world will lose the stigma against nuclear energy and pivot towards implementing it on a wider scale.


#### Education:

Education is poised to change dramatically. I found it hard to incorporate it into the story, but there’s no doubt that it’s due an evolution. With online degrees becoming more reputable, to custom bots (maybe even in the form of your lecture or an industry expert) that can help teach you the concept in exactly the way you understand, education is changing now more than ever. Even still the story is set in seven years, with University (and education in general) being an institution that’s hundreds of years old. It’s not going anywhere just yet. That said, I do imagine the education my kids will get to be wildly different from the one I grew up on. 


# Conclusion:

Simply, the world is rapidly advancing, far faster than we realise. Granted, it won’t be unrecognisable from today. Some things will never change. But the future I wrote is one I’m excited for. It’s a future where technology is now customised to every individual, enabling us to do so much more with it.  It’s a future where technology is an even larger multiplier of (the best of) humanity than it is today. It’s a future I’m excited to help create.

### What's a word?
Have you ever thought about it? It's a pairing between a *form* (sound) and a *meaning* (they're memorised). A rose doesn't exactly smell sweet or feel thorny, but we evoke that idea. It's useful when considering [[Human Nature]] but also [[Natural Language Processing]].

### How Else Can You Break Language Down?
##### Words:
Explained above
##### Sounds:
Break it into [[Phonemes]].
##### Meaningful Sub-components:
Meaningful (in the literal sense) sub-components of words ([[Morphemes]])
##### Syntax:
The rules of a language - explained [[Syntax in Language|here]].

### Learning Language:
- Learning language occurs in bursts. Children between 3-8 hear a word once and can instantly go on using it."
Linear Approximation.md,"Linear Approximation.md

### What:
In [[Calculus]], when something is hard to calculate, we may try to get an approximation. The general form is as follows: $f(x) \approx L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)$

### Example:
Take $\sqrt{9.2}$ -> using $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ and $f'(x)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$ and $a=9$. Thus $\sqrt{9.2} \approx 3 + \frac{1}{6} \cdot 0.2 = 3.033\ldots$"
Cryptographic Hash Functions.md,"Cryptographic Hash Functions.md

## Background
Have you ever considered how we verify the authenticity of certain messages? We use a ***One Way Function*** called Hashing. Basically, we take anything, and convert it to a seemingly random (but entirely deterministic) string. 

There's also the desire for a ***collision resistant function***. What does that mean? A function that makes it really hard to find two messages $m_1$ and $m_2$ such that $f(m_1) = f(m_2)$. 

## For what?
It's used for a lot:
- File integrity when downloading something (you can compare your hash to the sites)
- Password verification - instead of storing plaintext passwords - you store their hashes."
Anonymous Communication.md,"Anonymous Communication.md

## What:
One of the cornerstones of [[SSL - TLS]] was that no-one could tell the contents of the message, but they could know who was talking to who, how long they communicated etc. What if we wanted a form of communication that avoided all of that (as well encrypting the message)?"
P-Values.md,"P-Values.md

### What:
A [[Statistics|statistical]] tool used to measure the strength of evidence against a ***Null Hypothesis***. The The Null Hypothesis is the default statement that there's no difference of effect.

### How to Calculate P-Value

### The Meaning of P-Values:
- ***Very Low:*** It's unlikely to have happened naturally
- ***Very High***: It's likely to have happened"
Standard Normal Deviation.md,"Standard Normal Deviation.md

A special case of [[Binomial Distribution]]. It's the perfect one. The median is 0. The standard deviation is 1. 

![[Pasted image 20231115134409.png|500]]

### Standardising a Normally Distributed Random Variable
Sometimes, you wanna turn a non-standard distribution into a standard one. To do this, simply apply the formula:
$Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$"
Page Table.md,"Page Table.md

### Simply:
A table ([[Data Structures]]) that maps [[Virtual Memory|virtual addresses]] to [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually|physical addresses]]. Each *running* program has its own page table. That's how the OS maintains the illusion each process has its own contiguous block of virtual memory. 

The table has a bunch of entries (Page Table Entries - PTE's, which varies on length based on implementation). Each entry is made up of *status bits* (Resident and dirty for eg) and the Physical Page Number. This PPN is the physical address (not including the offset). 
### Translating Virtual Addresses to Physical Addresses:
Take a *32 bit* address, with $1KB$ large pages. You need 10 bits to represent which byte within the page you're referring to. Thus, you have 22 bits left for representing the amount of pages you have within your page table. 

### Resident and Dirty Bit:
Each PTE (Page Table Entry) has a *Resident Bit*. $R=1$ for pages stored in RAM, and 0 for otherwise. There's a *page fault exception* when $R=0$ -> *I.E The virtual address you seek is not in RAM, it's on disk*.

There's also a *Dirty Bit*. $D=1$ if we've changed this page since loading from disk (and therefore need to write it to disk when it's replaced). Think dirty [[Cache]]. 

### Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB):
Imagine having to, for every single instruction, translate *every single address*. This would be *extremely slow*. Cue the [[Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)]]

### Calculating Page Table:"
Knapsack Problem.md,"Knapsack Problem.md

### What?
> [!note] The Knapsack Problem
> *Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the **total weight** is **less than** or equal to a given **limit** and the **total value** is as **large as possible**.*
> 
> It's solvable with [[Dynamic Programming]]. 

### Details:
As the amount of options increase, the difficulty grows [[Time Complexity|exponentially]]. After each item you add to the collection (the knapsack), you have to re-evaluate which items you can now add. 


### Illustration:

### What?
The atoms of ***spoken*** language. It's the smallest unit of sound that can distinguish meaning between two words. They're abstract categories of ***sound***. If you group them together into triplets, you get [[Wicklephones]].

Context-Free Language.md,"Context-Free Language.md

### What?
It's a type of [[Language]] with specific types of rules. 

### Contains:
A grammar $G=(S,N,T,P)$ where:

- ***Start symbol $S$:*** **(** *Exp* in this case - $S \in N$ **)** and 
- ***Non-terminals $N$:*** **(** *Exp*, *Var*, *Num* - $N$ **)** , 
- ***Terminals $T$:*** **(***+, -, 0...9, (, ), x, etc - $\Sigma$***)**, 
- ***Rules / Productions $P$:*** ($P$ of the form $X \rightarrow \alpha$, where $X \in N$, $\alpha \in (\Sigma \cup N)^*$). 
- *Rules example*:
 ```
	Exp → Exp + Exp
	Exp → Exp * Exp
	Exp → Var | Num | ( Exp )
	Var → x | y | z
	Num → 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
```
- *Example legal sentence tree* (aka syntax tree, Parse Tree) of above:
	![[Pasted image 20240206195617.png|200]]
- An Abstract Syntax Tree would be a more concise, high entropy version of that tree. 

### How do you build a tree from a sentence?
I'm glad you asked. Cue the [[CYK Algorithm]]!

## Writing Languages Concisely:
- **x\***: zero or more occurrences of **x**
- **x+**: one or more occurrences of **x**
- **\[x\]**: zero or one occurrence of x

### Left Parsable Grammars:
Take a language with terms like:
- `term_1 | ... | term_n`
- `fact_1, | ...| fact_n`
- `[exp], exp*`

**Left Parsable Grammars are ones where the terms do not share initial symbols.** This makes life tremendously easier later one, cos we only need to (and now can) lookahead a single character in the parsing."
TCP Vs UDP.md,"TCP Vs UDP.md

## What?
There are two main protocols in the [[TCP-IP|Transport Layer]] part of the TCP/IP suite of protocols. They're all about transporting data *reliably* or *unreliably* from machine to machine. 

### *TLDR:*
- TCP is slower, more reliable, ensures data integrity, and is typically used for web browsing, email and file transfers.
- UDP is faster but less reliable, and is typically used for streaming, gaming and VoIP.

### TCP:
- **Connection-based**: TCP first establishes a connection between the sender and receiver *before* transmitting data. (Three way handshake)
- **Reliable**: TCP sends acknowledgements (ACKs) back for each successfully received packet (thus can be resent in case of error). Includes checksum for validation and sequence numbers to rebuild the packets. 
	- Each packet has a sequence number in its header - signifying what position in the original order it came.
	- With *each packet* successfully received, the endpoint sends back an ***ACK***. 
- **Slower**: Cos of the establishing the connection and the additional overhead.
- **Flow & Congestion Control**: To avoid overwhelming the receiver, TCP uses the [[Sliding Window Protocol]]. 
- This guys in charge of a lot of the ports. 
![[Pasted image 20240910103829.png|300]]

#### TCP's Three Way Handshake:
- TCP is all about having clear, consistent, reliable communications between computer and server. They begin their communication like so:
1. **Client** sends a `SYN` segment. - *""Hey Server! Can we start talking (ie can you open a connection for me)?*
2. **Server** acknowledges with a `SYN-ACK`. - *""Sure thing! Open one for me too!""*
3. **Client** acknowledges with `ACK` - *""Sure! Now we're talking!""* 

*Note about the numbers: They're both keeping track of the package they sent, and the number the other person last saw. This helps them tell if one was sent out of order accidentally.*

![[Pasted image 20241212100943.png|600]]
#### The Actual Communication Under TCP:
- If at some point the `seq num` or `ack num` is incorrect, the client/server will say *""Hold up! Missing a packet!""* 

#### Syn Flooding:
- If *Attacker* sends a bunch of `syn` packets (low memory), the server's queue will hold half-open connections. 
- Once the queue is full, the server can't handle legitimate requests. (Because it has no space for any more `SYN` entries)
- What if attacker spoofed its address as well? 
###### Defense:
- Firewalls
- Rate Limiting
- 

### UDP:
- **Connection-less**: Does not establish a connection beforehand. It just sends packets *Hail Mary* style.
- **Unreliable:** There's no error recovery on lost packets. Hell, there's no way of (as the sender) even knowing if your packets got there (to the receiver) in the first place. 
- **Faster**: Because you're just shooting packets willy-nilly, you can afford to spam them *much* faster. 


> [!quote] Lol
> ""*I'd tell you a funny joke about UDP but you might not get it*""

### UDP MultiCast:
This is just UDP but focused on sending it to across *multiple, specified* devices and systems. It works by:
- Receivers join a multicast group. (A specified subnet of IP addresses)
- The senders just blindly send to the subnet. 
- Good for Video conferencing, stock price distribution etc. 
- Also avoids having sending unnecessary packets to the internet."

Texas Hold'em Poker.md,"Texas Hold'em Poker.md

### What is it really though?
If it were only a game of chance, how come Bryn Kenney profited $54 million in his career? It's a mix of [[Probability]] and people skills. 

### Rules:
- ***Goal of Poker:*** Walk away from the table with more chips than you came in with
- ***Goal of each round:*** Either by every other player giving up or you or having the best hand at a showdown, you take the chips that were put into the middle of the table
### Table Position:
The position you play at in the table is very important. The person to the left of the Dealer / Button has to act immediately, without any information of what other people have. Consequently, the dealer (Button) and person to the right (CO - Cutoff) have the most information.

Chomsky Normal Form.md,"Chomsky Normal Form.md

### What
It's a subset of [[Context-Free Language]] with 3 strict requirements. They are:
1. $A$ -> $BC$ (two non-terminals)
2. $A$ -> $a$ (a single terminal)
3. $A$ -> $\epsilon$ (empty string)

### Why bother?
Well it turns out ***any legal production ruleset*** of a [[Language]] (specifically [[Context-Free Language]]) can be transformed into CNF. Then we can apply the [[CYK Algorithm]] to turn a sentence into a tree using the CNF version of it."
Events (Probability).md,"Events (Probability).md

A collection/subset of possible [[Sample Space]] based on specific rules. It's *simple* if it contains only a single element. It's *compound* otherwise."
Data Representation or Types.md,"Data Representation or Types.md

### Ways Representing Data:
- [[(Computer) Bit]]
- [[Binary|Representing Numbers and Data as Binary]]
- [[Hexadecimal Notation]]

### Data Types:
Hardware has a few different (fixed size) data-types. When trying to squash a larger data-type into smaller one, it creates [[Data Overflow]]. 

### Operating on Data Types:
- [[Shifting]]


### Converting Data Types to larger types:
Also kinda easy. If you're converting a number in English from 024 to 6 digits, you'd add a 0 3 more times. It's exactly the same as converting a [[Byte]] to a [[Short]]. Whatever sign the [[2s Complement Representation]] has, just repeatedly extend that sign to fill up the new space. EG:

Greedy Approximation Algorithms.md,"Greedy Approximation Algorithms.md

### What:
A specific type of [[Greedy Algorithms]]. These are for when getting exact solutions are largely impractical. Ideally they:
- Run in polynomial time.
- Compute a solution that's *""close""* to the optimal one. (I.E. Reasonably accurate)

### Problem: What's ""*close* to optimal""?

> [!danger] Key Idea
> Well if our solution is not far from **something that's *even* smaller than the optimal**, then it surely isn't far from the optimal.
##### Thus, a technique:
Bound the optimal solution *from below* (for minimisation problems - like below) and *above* (for maximisation problems). 
![[Pasted image 20240312114040.png|500]]
### Characteristics: 
1. At each decision, the algorithm chooses the option that's the ***locally optimal*** one. (I.e. looks best at that moment - the *""Greedy""* part).
2. It ***doesn't backtrack*** -  once a choice is made, the algorithm doesn't reconsider it. 
3. They're ***simple and fast***.

### [[Approximation Ratio]]:
$$R = \frac{\text{Cost of Approximation Solution}}{\text{Cost of Optimal Solution}}$$

### Specific Examples:
- [[Load Balancing]]

### Approximating [[NP Completeness|NP Hard Problems]]:
It's really hard to approximate some problems. The best approximation we can get is: [[Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme]]"
Polynomial Time Reduction.md,"Polynomial Time Reduction.md

### What:
Imagine having an unsolved problem *A*. If we have a similar solved problem *B*, then we may be able to transform */* *reduce* *A* into *B*. This closely relates to reducing an [[NP Completeness|NP problem]] into a P problem. 

**Simply**: Can you reduce Problem A into problem B, solve B and in turn solve A in polynomial time? If you can, then that Algorithm (that reduces and solves A with B as a subroutine) is a polynomial time reduction.


### Different Types of Reductions:
- ***Many-One Reduction:*** A specific type of polynomial-time reduction where each instance of problem A is mapped onto a single instance of problem B."
Digital Signature.md,"Digital Signature.md

## What?
Similar to an actual digital signature in the real world, it's a cryptographic string that **mathematically proves** that something is coming from a specific person. It's a similar method to the [[Asymmetric Encryption|double encryption]] thing. 

### How?
1. We take the document that requires a signature.
2. We hash it.
3. We add padding
4. We then encrypt that with our private key. (Because if our public key opens it, then it was from us). 

### Why does this work?
1. We sign our hash with our private key. Since only our public key would reveal it, then it must have been us (this is the actual signature part). 
2. The recipient of the document can be sure that the public key is authentic thanks to the [[Certificate Authority]], and the [[Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)|PKI]] in general.
3. If the attacker would try to change anything, the hash would look different. 

### How would this look in actuality?
1. We'd send bunch of messages
2. We'd take a summary of the ones we sent, hash them and encrypt them with our private key.
3. Thus anyone receiving can take those messages, do the same and decrypt with our public key. If they were truly from us, they'll be the same. 
4. Pretty neat, eh?"
ChatGPT in Education.md,"ChatGPT in Education.md

I have mixed feelings about using ChatGPT to learn something new. 

#### [Socraticly](https://chatgpt.com/share/6750b8aa-9f14-8005-8e5b-262d9a73519f):
[[Learning]] should be hard. We actively learn better when we're in the trenches of something and have to tackle it thoroughly. It's how I learned [[Calculus]]. A similar effect is achieved when we have a personal tutor challenging everything we know. In the future, [[Time Capsule|AI Tutors]] will play this role. 

#### Unfortunately, We Take the Shortest Path:
Now, with ChatGPT, when we have an error, it's much easier to copy and paste it and ask for the solution. No real learning happens here. Unfortunately, if it's available, it's what we're going to do."
Principal Component Analysis (PCA).md,"Principal Component Analysis (PCA).md

> [!danger] Note:
> Detailed information can be found in *13.1* [here](https://opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-11/FDS-lecture-notes-2023-11-27.pdf). It's helpful and is more robust on the maths. 
### What's PCA all about?
High-dimensional data is a balls and often it could be condensed (think data that has columns *Height* and *Shoe Size*). Solution? Reduce the different dimensions to purely the dimensions that tell different and unique stories about the data. These new dimensions are the ***Principal Components***.

> [!summary] ChatGPT Analogy
> Imagine you have a large 3D file of a building and you want to reduce the size of it while keeping as much information as possible. You could take 5 still images of the building (1 each side and 1 of roof). You've condensed the file size but kept the crucial information from the unique principal components. 

### How do you do it?
###### High Level:
1. Your first principal component is the one with the highest variance.
2. Your next is one that orthogonal to that one. 
3. Keep going until you've all...

### Example:
![[Screenshot 2024-01-14 at 5.39.20 p.m..png|500]]

The above is a scatter plot for the 2 principal components, `PC1` and `PC2` of data referring to Scotland's secondary schools, their students and the towns of which they're in. You can see the vectors orthogonal to `PC2` are all to do with `Area Deprivation`. Whereas to `PC21 it's all about `Distance from School`. 

### The Maths Behind the Graph 😱:
- The ***Principal Component Scores*** represent the new datapoints after they've been conformed to your new PCs. Mathematically: $$\begin{align}
t_{i1} &= p_{11}z_{i1} + p_{21}z_{i2} + \ldots + p_{D1}z_{iD} \\
t_{i2} &= p_{12}z_{i1} + p_{22}z_{i2} + \ldots + p_{D2}z_{iD}
\end{align}
$$
	***Explanation***:
	- $t_{i1}$ and $t_{i2}$ are the ***new coords*** for the original data points, now conformed to *PC1* and *PC2* respectively.
	- $z_{iD}$ are the ***variables***, where $i$ is the $i$th datapoint and $D$ is the $D$th variable. (Variable representing *Attendance*, *Unemployment* etc.)
	- $p_{11}$ and $p_{12}$ are the ***weights*** each new variable has on the new coord. 

- What about the ***Original Vectors*** (*Attendance*, *Unemployment* etc)?:
	- Check the page above lol.

### Their Usefulness:
Remember, PCs explain portions of the variance in the data. You can graph it as such. **Rule of thumb**: only use the PC's to the *left of the elbow*

Parameters of a Distribution.md,"Parameters of a Distribution.md

When referring to a [[Probability Distributions - PMF vs PDF vs CDF vs More|Probability Distribution]], they have unique characteristics. These characteristics can be referred to as a *Parameters*. 

### Different Parameters:
- **Mean ($μ$)**: The average value of the distribution. For a normal distribution, it determines the center of the distribution.
- **Variance ($σ²$)**: Measures the spread of the distribution; how far the values are from the mean. In a normal distribution, it determines the width of the bell curve.
- **Standard Deviation ($σ$)**: The square root of the variance, also a measure of spread.
- **Probability ($p$)**: In a binomial distribution, $p$ is the probability of success in a single trial.
- **Number of Trials ($n$)**: In a binomial distribution, $n$ is the number of independent trials.
- **Rate ($λ$)**: In a Poisson distribution, $λ$ is the average number of events in a given interval.
- **Shape Parameters ($α$, $β$, etc.)**: Some distributions, like the beta or gamma distributions, have shape parameters that determine the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution.

(Computer) Memory Conceptually.md,"(Computer) Memory Conceptually.md

### Specifically, what kind of memory?
This page relates to everything conceptually of how we store in physical registers, how we do it and what exactly is stored there. Click here for more about [[DRAM]]. Or click here to find out more about the [[Stack vs Heap]] (I.E. how the data is separated on the RAM level). 

### What Exactly is Memory?
How do you store data in computers? First, the meaning of memory is really context dependent. It could genuinely mean a lot of things. Can refer to the slower memory (hard drives, SSDs etc.). It could also refer to [[Registers]]. 

### Goals and Types of Memory
- Large
- Fast
- Randomly Accessible
Since this is not possible for a single piece of memory, we have a [[Memory Hierarchy]]. We combine different kinds to give the illusion of that. There's different types of memory:
- [[SRAM]]
- [[DRAM]]
- [[Cache]]
- [[Flash SSD]]
- [[Hard Disk]]


### Conceptually Actually Storing Data
Ok. How do you store data in computers? For now, let's address this problem as storing in a *""memory system""*. (For illustrative purposes we'll talk about a 32-bit system.)

Few things to understand first. A ***word*** is a 32-bit (4 byte) long [[Binary|binary]] data. When we store data, we store it in chunks (words) because it makes accessing, addressing and using just so much easier. (And a ***byte*** is *8 bits* long)

The following is an example of **aligned*** memory. Now how do we where specific things are? We give them addresses. The best way to arrange these addresses? Multiples of 4. Why? Each word is 4 bytes. How do we know when one stops and the other begins? Just jump ahead in multiples of 4. . So whenever you say ""get me the data stored in byte 4"", you're actually getting the next word (32 bits) that starts at the 16th bit. 
![[Screenshot 2023-10-05 at 1.31.57 p.m..png|150]]

## What's the Policy?
- Controls how accessible cookies are with flags:
	- `SameSite` 
	- `Secure` (Https only)
- And Scope:
	- Basically just which domains can access it.
		- ***Cookies are set to domains. They will apply to any subset of that domain.*** 
			- EG: Cookie set for `example.com` applies to `www.foo.example.com`. 
			- This is dangerous because

### Cookies' Attributes:
![[Pasted image 20241129115917.png|500]]

### Who can set cookies?
- The cookie is set by the server in [[TCP-IP|header response]]. 

## Cookie Stealing / Session Hijacking :
If someone got access to your cookie, they pretend to be you... How could they do this?
#### Guessing / Looking:
- Thus, cookies should be unpredictable. 
- If the cookie gets sent over plaintext (cos HTTP was used), then you're a bit cooked. 

#### Cross Site Scripting:
- Cookies are stored locally in your browser. 
- We'll inject a script into an insecure blog. The script could take the users' cookies and send them to the attacker. 
- There's 2 types:
##### Stored XSS:
- The script is *stored* on the server, and the user comes upon it when requesting the resource
	- EG: Script is stored in comments section, victim gets infected when they're loaded.
- The more dangerous one ngl.

##### Reflected XSS:
- Imagine you made a google search for something, and it looked like:
	- `https://google.com/search?q=<script>exploit here</script>`
- If you then got the victim to go to that link, then the user would be hacked cos on the screen you'd have: 
	- *""Here's the results for \<a script hehehe\>...""*
- More realistically, if someone goes to a malicious link, they could have a script that actually calls Google etc. and gets the cookie from that.

##### Defences Against XSS:
- Escape dynamic data before actually writing it. 
- Input Validation
- ***CSP:*** Server provides a list of allowed whitelisted scripts. 

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):
- When a malicious website (`evil.com`) tricks the user's browser into making a request to a trusted one where the user is already authenticated (`bank.com`). 
- Remember cookies have a `domain` flag. If the user is already authenticated on `bank.com`, any request the browser makes to `bank.com` will include any relevant cookies.  
- The servers at `bank.com` will assume the request is legitimate, and treat it as such. (They'd have no reason not to.)
- Soooo if our `evil.com` can manage to make a request to `bank.com` from the victim's browser, then boom. 
##### How to prevent?
- ***CSRF Tokens:*** Each user session has unique token. The server validates it's legitimate.
	- Therefore, it's up to sites to check that the request is coming from who it says it is.

It's the formula for calculating the sum of all of those rectangles under a function (Leading to the idea of [[Integrals]]).

- Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function and $P$ is a subsection in the interval
- Let $\Delta x$ be the width of each subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ -> $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}$
- For each $i$, let $x_i^*$ be ***any point*** in $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$. -> $x_i = a + \Delta x \cdot i$


A Riemann sum is defined for $f(x)$ as

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*)\Delta x

Combining & Multiplying Power Series.md,"Combining & Multiplying Power Series.md

### Combining [[Power Series]]

#### Theorem

Suppose that the two power series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n x^n$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} d_n x^n$ converge to the functions $f$ and $g$, respectively, on a common interval $I$.

i. The power series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n x^n \pm d_n x^n$ converges to $f \pm g$ on $I$.

ii. For any integer $m \geq 0$ and any real number $b$, the power series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b^m c_n x^n$ converges to $b^m f(x)$ on $I$.

iii. For any integer $m \geq 0$ and any real number $b$, the series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n (bx^m)^n$ converges to $f(bx^m)$ for all $x$ such that $bx^m$ is in $I$.

***Intuition***: If you can represent functions $f$ and $g$ as two power series, then $f\pm g$ is the sum of those two power series. Also multiplying a constant to the power series is equivalent to multiplying the function by it. Pt3 lowkey intuitive already.


### Multiplying Power Series
#### Theorem

Suppose that the power series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n x^n$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} d_n x^n$ converge to the functions $f$ and $g$, respectively, on a common interval $I$. Let

$e_n = c_0d_n + c_1d_{n-1} + c_2d_{n-2} + \ldots + c_{n-1}d_1 + c_nd_0 = \sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k d_{n-k}$.

Then,

$\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n x^n\right)\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} d_n x^n\right) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} e_n x^n$,

and $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} e_n x^n$ converges to $f(x) \cdot g(x)$ on $I$.

The series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} e_n x^n$ is known as the Cauchy product of the series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n x^n$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} d_n x^n$."

Power Series.md,"Power Series.md

### What?
It's a way of representing a function, centered around a given point, by a [[Series]]. It's in the form

$$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n(x - c)^n$$

An example of $f(x)=e^x$, where $a_n=\frac{1}{n!}$ and $c=0$. 
$$
f(x)=e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}
$$
### How do you convert / find a Power Series?:
Check [[Converting Function to Power Series]]

### Differentiation / Integration:
Think about it. If they perfectly represent a continuous function, then they're differentiable. We simply differentiate / integrate each term. 

$f'(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} nc_n (x - a)^{n-1} = c - 1 + 2c_2(x - a) + 3c_3(x - a)^2 + \ldots$

### Relation to [[Taylor Series]]:
Taylor series are simply a specific type of Power Series, except they're about using derivatives at a point to gain information about the function around that point. 

### What happens if you extend the [[Series]] out into infinity?
Well, if it only ever gets better and better at representing it, then it's known to ***converge***. Otherwise, if it hits a point on either side of the original point that it oscillates around, then it's known to ***diverge***. The points on either side are known as the ***[[Radius of Convergence]]***."

Processes.md,"Processes.md

> [!note] Note
> This page is for ***computer processes***. I don't know why you'd ever make one about the English term, but hey, in case you do, you've now got a clear distinction.

## What
It's an instance of a program that's currently executing. It has [[Process States|states]]. About:
- They must be loaded into [[Virtual Memory]] and uniquely identified (`pid`).
- `pid`'s have CPU times, memory usage, user ID that spawned it - `uid`, etc.
- Processes might control other processes (*fork*).
- Child process inherits context from parent process.

#### What can it do?
- By default, the process only has the [[Privilege Separation|privileges]] that it's parent `uid` has. 

#### Permissions! (Lowkey quite cool)
Every process has 3 user IDs:
- ***Real User ID*** (`uid`): The user ID that actually started the process
- ***Effective User ID*** (`euid`): The user ID that determines the process' privileges. For example, you may want to temporarily run `sudo`, at which point the terminal's command changes its `euid` to `0` (root's).
- ***Saved UserID*** (`suid`): We save the user ID before changing the `euid` so we can go back to it."
HeapSort.md,"HeapSort.md

Related to working with the [[Heap (Data Structure)]]. It's an `in-place` algorithm (no auxiliary array). Does not maintain the order between relative keys (not stable sorting). 

### Steps to Run:
1. Preprocess the array so it can be represented as a heap.
2. Extract the root and swap it with the last element in the array. 
3. Seen as the heap requirements may be violated, *heapify* the array again (make it back into a heap). (Steps 2 and 3 are $O(\lg(n))$)
4. Repeat the process for all bar the last element in the array.
5. Repeat until sorted.

### Heapify (I.E. Taking step 3)?
I'll admit, the idea of *Heapifying* was incredibly handwave-y. Recall the [[Heap (Data Structure)|heap properties]]. If one of them gets violated, perform the following:
0. Given a tree with a single violation, perform the rest. (I.E. The 2 subtrees you use for comparison should be heaps). 
1. Look at the node you want to heapify. Compare it with its children.
2. Find the largest. 
3. If parent node is not the largest, swap with the largest child. 
4. If a swap was made, recursively heapify the affected subtree, as some heap conditions may have been violated.
 
### Running Time of Heapify:
Think for a second. If all operations in heapifying are constant bar the actual recursive step, the only thing that will determine the time complexity is how many iterations you call. This is going to be the height of the node at which you called it. If you have a n items, it will be $\lg(n)$. 

$\therefore O(\lg(n))$ 
![[Screenshot 2023-10-31 at 4.37.46 p.m..png|400]]

### But Heapifying the Entire Array?
Heapifying only works when your two sub-trees are both heaps. The only place we can absolutely guarantee that? The parents of leaves (Defined [[Balanced Search Trees|trees]] - the most bottom layer). We can use that to upwardly jump and heapify as we go. Time complexity is $O(n)$
 
1. Call Heapify on the parents of leaves, in order or strictly decreasing from the first leaf. (I.E. The parent of the last leaf)

Look up an animation for this."
Balanced Search Trees.md,"Balanced Search Trees.md

### Fundamental Idea:
These are another type of [[Data Structures]]. All operations have an average and worst case *[[Time Complexity]]* of $\Theta(lg(n))$. 

BSTs must maintain specific properties in order to keep them efficient. If they break a property, they must be rebalanced - Rotated. 

![[Screenshot 2023-10-30 at 9.38.04 a.m..png|400]]

## What Are Rotations?
This is altering the structure of the tree by rearranging subtrees, with the goal of decreasing the height of the tree. Crucially, rotations don't affect the order of elements. 

### Right Rotations:
```java
    y                x
   / \              / \
  x   C    ==>     A   y
 / \                  / \
A   B                B   C
```
1. You take the node you want to perform a rotation on (E.G. *y*)
2. You *swing* it down to the right and takes the place of what was there (*B* in this case). 
3. Whatever was there (*B*) now gets thrown onto the left of the node that got swung down (*y*)

### Left Rotations:
Literally the same, just the opposite. 
```java
    x                y
   / \              / \
  A   y     ==>    x   C
     / \          / \
    B   C        A   B
```
### Left - Right Rotation:
```java
    z                      z                      y
   / \                    / \                    / \
  x   D                  y   D                  /   \
 / \          ==>       / \          ==>       x     z
A   y                  x   C                  / \   / \
   / \                / \                    A   B C   D
  B   C              A   B
```
### Right Left - Rotation:
```java
    x                      x                      y
   / \                    / \                    / \
  A   z                  A   y                  /   \
     / \      ==>           / \      ==>       x     z
    y   D                  B   z              / \   / \
   / \                        / \            A   B C   D
  B   C                      C   D

## Red-Black Search Tree:
![[Screenshot 2023-10-29 at 4.57.44 p.m..png|500]]
##### Criteria:
- A specific type of BST. 
- Node is either red or black
- The *root* (top/base) and *leaves* (the very last nodes at bottom - NIL) are black.
- If a node is red, then its children are black
- All paths from a node to it's NIL descendants contain the same amount of black nodes. 
	- This is also known as the *""Black-height of the red-black tree""*. 
	- You don't count the starting node. 
- The path to the farthest NIL is *never more than twice* the length to the shortest NIL.

#### Strategy for Insertion in RB Tree:
1. Insert desired node and colour it red
2. Recolour and rotate the rest of the nodes to adjust for any potential violations

	- Interestingly, every language seems to share this law.
	-  

- ***Mathematically:*** $f(r) \propto \frac{1}{r^s}$ , where:
	- $f(r)$ is the frequency of a word with rank $r$,
	- $r$ is the rank of the word (1 for the most frequent word, 2 for the second-most frequent, and so on),
	- $s$ is a parameter typically close to 1 (it determines how steep the frequency drop-off is),
	- $\propto$ means ""proportional to.""

Difference in Proportions.md,"Difference in Proportions.md

### What?
In [[A-B Testing]], we often want to compare different success rates between two different groups. The formula for getting the standard error of proportions is very tightly linked with [[Standard Error]] in general. 


The formula for ***standard error in proportions*** is: $$SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}$$
We can use this to say ""*We're X% confident that the true difference between the two proportions falls between that range*""."

Packet Switching.md,"Packet Switching.md

## What:
It's a key part of [[TCP-IP]]. Basically, the data that's to be sent, is split into packets:

- Packets could take different routes between the same endpoint
- They could also be dropped and never delivered."

Simple Linear Regression.md,"Simple Linear Regression.md

> [!note] What is it?
> A form of model-based [[Prediction Problems|prediction]]. Used for continuous variables, as opposed to [[Classification]] which is for discrete categories. 

### How do you do Linear Regression (and [[AI|Machine Learning]] in general):
1. Specify the model
2. Specify the loss function
3. Minimise the loss
 

### How does it work?
1. We assume x and y are related by: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \text{noise}$
	- *Note*: This is very similar to the equation of a line. 
2. We optimise the model to be the line with the smallest average distance to all of the lines ($\therefore \text{Loss} \equiv \text{sum of squared prediction errors}$). 
	- In *English*: Square each prediction's distance from the line and add them up. 
	- Mathematically, that looks like: 
	- The ***Loss*** is called ***Quadratic Loss*** or ***Sum of Square Errors***.
	- Note: Squaring the loss penalises overshooting and undershooting as equally bad. 
	- $$
\begin{align}
\text{Prediction:}\quad\hat{y}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} \\
\text{Error:}\quad e_i = \underbrace{y_i}_{\text{actual}} - \underbrace{\hat{y}_i}_{\text{predicted}}\\
\text{Loss:}\quad f(\beta_0, \beta_1) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i^2
\\
\end{align}
$$
3. Minimise the loss. 


### Example of above:
![[Pasted image 20231228132634.png|500]]

### Optimisation Techniques for Linear Regression
A common way to optimise for the correct $\beta$'s is the following formulae, known as '***Least Squares Estimate***'. 

### Optimal Solutions:
Once you have an optimised line, there's still points that don't go through it (technically still errors). They're known as ***Residuals***. 
- $\hat{e}_i = y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i) = y_i - \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 (x_i - \bar{x})$


> [!info] Smallest Loss Achievable:
> The optimisation here lies in minimising the ***residuals***. Why? Well because if your line is as close to all points not on the line as possible, and no alterations could make them closer, then you've the best fitting model. The formula for that (I.E. The *smallest possible loss*)?: 
> 
> $$\min f(\beta_0, \beta_1) = (n - 1)s_y^2(1 - r^2)$$

##### Dissecting The Formula:
- $n-1$: The number of data points
- $s_y^2$: Variance of target
	- Predicting something that's more variable is *much* harder. Thus as the variability increases, smallest possible loss also increases. 
- $1-r^2$: Regression Co-efficient. 
	- If $r=1$, $x$ is perfectly correlated with $y$. If $r=0$, $x$ is perfectly non-correlated with $y$
	- Loss decreases as"

OS Memory Management (x86).md,"OS Memory Management (x86).md

> [!note] Umm.. Actually ☝️
> The **x86** architecture and [[(MIPS) Assembly Language|MIPS]] share a lot of common ideas. The ***% registers*** we talk about below are just different flavours of the ***$ registers*** from MIPS.

## Components
- Like MIPS, you have program [[Registers|registers]]: 
	- `%eax` - The main register for holding results of arithmetic
	- `%ebx` - The main register for holding data. 
	- `%esp` - Extended Stack Pointer - Points to the top of the [[The Stack's Use in MIPS|stack]]. This updates every new operation that's done. 
	- `%ebp` - Extended Base Pointer - Whenever you jump to a new function, this points to the base of that function.

### [[Address Space|Memory Address Space]] in x86:
Let's walk through the provisioning of memory in [[x86]]... Below is a diagram of it, as well as of [[C (Programming Language)|C]] code we're about to run. 

##### Quickly! What's a stack frame!
Every time you run a function, you're actually jumping to a different [[(MIPS) Assembly Language|location]] in memory. But there's stuff you need to remember. For example:
- The parameters you're bringing along with you.
- Where to return to once you're done. (*Return Address*)
- *Stack Base Pointer* - Look at `%ebp` above. 
- etc. 

*Note: Remember this is [[Virtual Memory]], so the addresses are actually all split up and correspond to different physical addresses. Fucking love OS.* 
![[Pasted image 20241211160744.png|600]]
![[Pasted image 20241211161435.png|500]]
#### Step By Step:
1. Firstly, you add the function arguments to memory, in reverse order. 
2. You push the return address (the place to return to once the function is done).
3. Stack Base Pointer `%ebp` - look above.
4. Exception handlers
5. Canary goes here. Cos if your local variables are set to overwrite the base pointer, they'd trip up here first
6. Local Variables



## Careful!
- You should be incredibly careful when dealing directly with memory. Improper handling can lead to [[Data Overflow]]"
Integration.md,"Integration.md

Integration is mainly about a few things. (Note: These are all mathematically synonymous!)

It can be about being the ""AntiDerivative"" of a Derivative (Thanks to the [[Calculus|Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]]).

Thanks to some really cool Math, it can be about calculating the *area under the function $f(x)$*. Or really, any volume as well ([[Volume by Slicing]]). This also comes with the idea of calculating the volume of a solid that was created when rotating a function (or pair of them) around the x-axis ([[Solids of Revolution]])

Partial Fractions.md,"Partial Fractions.md

### Why?
Sometimes, especially when integrating, you have a complicated fraction that you need to simplify. 

### Step 1: Ensure deg(Top) < deg(Bottom):
By long division, ensure the degree of the top is less than the one on the bottom. Factor out denominator
$$
\frac{x^2 - 2x - 35}{x^2 - 3x - 40}\rightarrow1 + \frac{x + 3}{x^2 - 3x - 40}\rightarrow1 + \frac{x + 3}{(x+5)(x-8)}$$

### Step 2: Set up partial fractions:
For this part, write out the actual $A$'s, $B$'s, etc.
- For linear factors $(x - a)$, you add a term $\frac{A}{x-a}$, where A is a constant.
- For repeated linear factors $(x - a)^n$, you add terms $\frac{A_1}{x-a} + \frac{A_2}{(x-a)^2} + \cdots + \frac{A_n}{(x-a)^n}$.
- For irreducible quadratic factors $(ax^2 + bx + c)$, you add a term $\frac{Ax+B}{ax^2+bx+c}$, where A and B are constants.
- For repeated irreducible quadratic factors, the approach is similar to repeated linear factors but with $Ax + B$ in the numerator for each term.

Propagation Delays.md,"Propagation Delays.md

### What?
When referring to [[Digital Circuits]], specifically [[Full Adder]], it's the rippling delays between the input signal and output signal. Obviously, when you combine a bunch of single-bit adders, for example, the delay between a single adder compounds to the full 32 bits. 

### Delay depends on:
1. The Tech (The transistor material, capacitance etc.)
2. The type of gate
3. *Fanning Out*
	- If you're outputting a signal from one gate into many gates, it will obviously take more time than if you were just outputting into a single other gate. 

### A problem:
What if you're working with 2 different circuits that have different amounts and types of gates. They would obviously have different delays. (Example below).

### Theorem

Consider the [[Series]] $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$. Let

$$
\rho = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_n|}.
$$

i. If $0 \leq \rho < 1$, then the series converges absolutely.

ii. If $\rho > 1$ or $\rho = \infty$, then the series diverges.

iii. If $\rho = 1$, then the test does not provide any information.

The root test is useful for series whose terms involve exponentials. In particular, for a series whose terms $a_n$ satisfy $|a_n| = b^n$, then $\sqrt[n]{|a_n|} = b$, and we need only evaluate $\lim_{n \to \infty} b_n$."

$$
\int_a^\infty f(x) \, dx = \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_a^t f(x) \, dx,

## What
A server that handles incoming traffic and distributes it to the actual servers.

![[Pasted image 20240910173523.png|500]]

### Strategies for Balancing Big Loads 😉
- **Round Robin:** Simple af. Just serve your servers in an iterative fashion and loop back around to the first once you've served them all.
	- **Works for:** Servers of equal specs and workloads of relatively equal size.
- **Least Connections:** Sends work to the servers based on how busy they already are.
	- **Good for**: Longer tasks or when server load isn't evenly distributed
- **Least Response Times**: Choses the most responsive, least laggy *and* least connected-to server. 
- **IP Hasher**: Gets Hash of IP and gives it to a server. Semi-equally-randomly directs a client to a server based on the client's hash. 
	- **Good For**: Ensuring a client has consistent access to servers.
- **Weighted Algo's**: Basically the same vibe for the first few, but each server is assigned weighting based on how busy / capable it is.

Binomial Random Variables.md,"Binomial Random Variables.md

Similar to [[Random Variable (Probability)]]:

### Binomial Random Variables
Imagine you're flipping a coin several times, and you're only interested in how many times it lands heads up. This situation, where you have a fixed number of identical trials (coin flips), and you're counting the number of successes (heads), can be described by a binomial random variable.

- **Trials**: You flip the coin 10 times.
- **Success**: The coin lands on heads.
- **Probability**: There's a 50% chance for heads on each flip.

Your binomial random variable X represents the number of heads you get in those 10 flips.

#### Expectation of Binomial Random Variables:
The number of successes you can expect after repeating an experiment many, many times.

#### Variance of a Binomial Random Variable
Variance for a binomial random variable measures how much the number of successes is likely to fluctuate from the expected value.

Still with the coin:
- You would not always get exactly 5 heads in 10 flips; sometimes it could be 3, other times 7. Variance captures this spread of possible outcomes around the expected 5 heads.

The formula for the variance of a binomial random variable $X$ with $n$ trials and probability of success $p$ is $n×p×(1−p)$. For our coin:

- Variance $=10×0.5×0.5=2.5$

This means if you repeatedly flipped the coin 10 times, the number of heads would typically vary from the average (5 heads) by about the square root of 2.5, which is about 1.58 (the standard deviation).

So while you expect 5 heads on average, it's typical to see a number of heads that's plus or minus around 1 or 2 from that average in any given set of 10 flips."

Currently, I'm working on using [[AI|Machine Learning]] for global path optimisation. More on that to come...

#### Previously at Formula Student:
In my first year, I was part of the ***[[Statics]]*** sub-team. When we want to Silverstone, we got awarded the best presentation they'd seen that year. We presented on:
- *The Risks of Bias in Black Box Self-Driving Models*
- *Neuro-symbolic AI as a Safety-First Learning Algorithm*
- *[[World's Readiness for SAE Level 4]]*

*Presenting our RWAI presentation*

## What Actually *Is* Formula Student:
It's a competition in Silverstone that's split into 2 sides, ADS *(Autonomous Driving System)* and DDT *(Dynamic Driver Tasks)* -> Think self-driving and driver-yes cars respectively. ***EUFS is one of the only teams in the UK that's building a car that can be driven by people and self-drive as well** (Dubbed the ADS Car).* 

#### ADS (Driverless):
This side focuses on writing the software that allows a car (normally one that the [IMechE](https://www.imeche.org/events/formula-student) provides) to drive itself. Our software team is split into several parts, including [[Localisation and Mapping|localisation and mapping]], [[Planning and Control|planning and control]], [[Perception|perception]] and more. (This is essentially the [[Software for AVs|stack]] that runs on self-driving car [[Cruise|companies]]). 

For the RL path optimisation, I'm working quite closely with *planning and control* and *simulation*.
##### ADS Challenges:
To prove you'd made something somewhat decent, they put your software through the ringer with a battery of tests. Everything from driving on unseen tracks *(as fast as possible)* to essentially drag races *(measuring start-top speed-stop times)*. 

![[DSC_7151.jpg]]
*Our software competing on the IMechE car. (We won ;) )*

## Current Draft of Slides:
### Intro + First Slide:

-   **Intro**: What’s the number one thing holding Autonomous vehicles back from SAE Level 4/5? Well according to top Waymo engineer, Anthony Levandowski, it’s model prediction.

- **Slide 1**: To see why, I invite you to a thought experiment. You’re driving down a quiet road past an edlerly couple on a bench. You drive like normal. You’re now driving down the same road but 2 schoolkids playing with a football are at the same spot. This time, you slow down and take a step aside.

- Why did you do this? Well because you’ve learned an intuitive sense of what people will do around you, and in turn the best way to react. Since AV’s can’t, we have to teach them

### 2nd Slide:

- And that’s what we’ve done. However unfortunately, many of the models aren’t the most in depth. The majority simply take “pedestrian… near road”, plug that into a neural network and tend slow down. There’s rarely the distinction between the kids and elderly couple.

### 3rd Slide:

-   The natural step is to understand more about a pedestrian’s or driver’s personality, and in turn decide how to act. This would theoretically lead to more sociable and safer driving.
-   The question to ask however, is do we actually want this?

### 4th Slide:

-   We know that machine learning algorithms are incredibly succeptible to becoming biased, with this 2019 study finding AV’s are less likely to recognise, and in turn more likely to crash into, people with darker skin tones.
-   Now consider what AV’s take in as input. With cameras, you take in age, gender, race. With GPS you take neighbourhood, or a proxy for income. Without proper car and supervision, they’re the perfect vehicle for learning our inherent inequality.

### Slide 4:

-   Self driving cars that will consistently perform worse for certain demographics presents a huge problem to the future of AVs. If we want to deploy AV’s across the world, we can’t just be content with it working well in a fairly homogeneous environment if it operates unsafely in my homeland of Mexico, or in Matt, the next speaker’s, homeland of South Africa.
-   As I alluded to before, all of this highlights the need for rigorous testing and functional safety.




## Cruise Feedback:
We had weekly meetings with [[Cruise]] and they gave us some really insightful feedback:
- Consider [[MAYA]] and [[The Adjascent Possible]]
- Focus on narrative. Have a central narrative that you weave from back and forth. The narrative can change as you go, that's ok. 
- [ ] Find a way to better jump between yours' and Matt's presentations


Matt Feedback:
- The Tech simply won't work in other places
- Weave in the idea of data
- Read up on the topic
- What are the bottlenecks
- Talk about Data driven models and the inherent difficulties / strengths with using Dat
- Change your presentation to be more about do we want cars to take on our inherent biases

## Second Draft: With refocus
### 1st Slide:
- **Intro**: What’s the number one thing holding Autonomous vehicles back from true autonomy? Well according to top Waymo engineer, Anthony Levandowski, it’s model prediction.

- That is - giving Autonomous vehicles the inherently human ability to see another human and predict what they're going to do. 
- Think for a moment, at how differently you'd react when driving down a road and you see an elderly couple vs driving down that same road and you see some young kids playing with a football dangerously close to the curb. 

### 2nd Slide:
- The goal, therefore, is to teach autonomous vehicles those same innate human abilities. And the means to do that? As with every single data driven models - simple. It's data. So that's what we've done.

- Between Waymo, Cruise, and Tesla vehicles have collectively driven *billions* of miles with *human* drivers. The companies then use that, essentially human annotated data, to train their Deep Neural Networks that will eventually be driving the car itself.

### 3rd Slide:
- What's more, research shows that by analysing the *people* and their personalities, around you, the car is even better able to predict how other people are going to react. 
- The question is however, do we even want this?

### 4th Slide:
- We know that machine learning algorithms are incredibly susceptible to becoming biased, with this 2019 study finding AV’s are less likely to recognise, and in turn more likely to crash into, people with darker skin tones.
- Now consider what AV’s take in as their input. With cameras, you take in age, gender, race. With GPS you take neighbourhood, or a proxy for income. Without proper car and supervision, they’re the perfect vehicle for learning our inherent inequality.

### 5th Slide:
- OK. So we know part of the problem is that because these cars are trained off human data, they inherently pick up our human biases. Do we want AV's to slow down cautiously when it enters a neighbourhood of low income?
- The second problem we will have to contend with is the inherent inequality of availability of data. That is to say, AV's will perform great in the data rich, homogenous"
Entropy.md,"Entropy.md

> [!warning] Important Distinction
> This page relates to Entropy in [[Information Theory]], not Thermodynamics. 

### What?
Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty, unpredictability or randomness in a system. The higher the unpredictability, the more information that is potentially contained in a message. *Minimum entropy is the **most informative** message*. 

### Mathematically:
$$H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) \log_b P(x_i)$$ Where:
- $P(x_i)$ is the probability of the occurrence of the $i$-th outcome 
- $b$ is typically base 2 (for information in bits). 
- $X$ is a discrete random variable with possible values $\{x_1, x_2, \dots ,x_n\}$
- $-\log_b P(x_i)$ refers to surprising-ness (surprisal)."
Centre of Mass of a Uniform Plane Lamina.md,"Centre of Mass of a Uniform Plane Lamina.md

Ok. This is definitely one of the harder applications of Integration, because it involves (at least how the course taught it - deffo would have been different if Sal Khan taught it) a bunch of slight nuances on how to do it. Long story short, there's no 1 size fits all for every possible lamina you get. 

Now for the fun. Take the following diagram:
![[Pasted image 20230805213844.png]]

There's a few things we need to establish before we can do any work with it. 
1. The *mass is uniformly distributed across the lamina*. I.E. It's equally dense all around.
2. In fact let's take that density thing a bit further. If we divide the entire shape into *equally tiny square units* and they all have the same mass, then let's call the density of each *square* $\rho$. You can also read this as ***mass per unit area***. If you have an area of 2 square units, then it's mass is $2\rho$. 

Ok great. Now say we want to find the location $G(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ (I.E. The centre of mass for the lamina). How would we go about it?
1. Divide the lamina into tiny pieces
2. Calculate the mass of one of those pieces
3. Calculate the moment of each of those masses
4. Using integration, get the sum of all of those moments (for each axis separately)
5. Using integration, get the sum of the masses of those small pieces
6. Using the [[Moments and Centres of Gravity - Mass|formula for centre of mass]], ($\frac{moments}{masses}$), calculate the Centre of Mass for both $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$."

Logistic Regression.md,"Logistic Regression.md

### What?
As opposed to [[Simple Linear Regression|Linear Regression]] - which predicts real values - Logistic Regression is all about predicting binary response variables. Often they predict [[Odds and Log Odds]]. 

### How?
Take the following example:
- $\hat{\beta}_{0}= 1.0$ 
- $\hat{\beta}_{1}= 0.5$
- $\hat{\beta}_{2}= -0.5$
- $\hat{\beta}_{3}= 0.1$
- $x^{(1)}$ Number of occurrences of phrase ""world-beating""
- $x^{(2)}$ Number of occurrences of phrase ""confidence interval""
- $x^{(3)}$ Number of occurrences of phrase ""bootstrap""
- $y$ Whether the paper was rejected (1) or sent out for review (0).
- ***Question:*** *Suppose a paper contains the phrase “world-beating” 5 times, and 0 occurrences of “confidence interval” or “bootstrap”. What is the predicted probability of rejection?*
###### Solution:
To calculate the predicted probability of rejection for a paper with 5 occurrences of ""world-beating"" and 0 occurrences of ""confidence interval"" and ""bootstrap"", we use the logistic regression coefficients and the following formula:

Log-odds = $\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot x_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 \cdot x_2 + \hat{\beta}_3 \cdot x_3$

Here, $x_1$ is the number of occurrences of ""world-beating"", $x_2$ is the number of occurrences of ""confidence interval"", and $x_3$ is the number of occurrences of ""bootstrap"". Given the coefficients $\hat{\beta}_0 = 1.0$, $\hat{\beta}_1 = 0.5$, $\hat{\beta}_2 = -0.5$, and $\hat{\beta}_3 = -0.1$, and the occurrences $x_1 = 5$, $x_2 = 0$, and $x_3 = 0$, the log-odds are:

Log-odds = $1.0 + (0.5 \cdot 5) + (-0.5 \cdot 0) + (-0.1 \cdot 0)$

Log-odds = $1.0 + 2.5$

Log-odds = $3.5$

To convert the log-odds to a probability, we use the logistic function:

$P(\text{rejection}) = \frac{e^{\text{Log-odds}}}{1+e^{\text{Log-odds}}}$

Plugging in the log-odds we calculated:

$P(\text{rejection}) = \frac{e^{3.5}}{1+e^{3.5}}$"
Expected Values.md,"Expected Values.md

Using [[Probability]], calculating the expected amount you'd gain based on probability. 
### Example:
Imagine a raffle where you have a $\frac{1}{1000}$ chance of winning a $\$500$. You get each raffle ticket for free. Each raffle ticket would expect to win you $\$0.50$ ($\frac{1}{1000} \times \$500 + \frac{999}{1000} \times 0$).

AlphaGo.md,"AlphaGo.md

A [[Reinforcement Learning]] algorithm developed by [[Google DeepMind]], it was the first computer to ever beat a world champion Go player."
TCP-IP.md,"TCP-IP.md

## What:
It's the set of networking protocols that establish a standardised way different systems communicate with each other, regardless of software / hardware environments. It's split into layers:

![[Pasted image 20240923164756.png|600]]

![[Pasted image 20240909170451.png|400]]

### 4. Application Layer
The layer that **tells the software on a computer/server the methods to reach out to the internet**. There's protocols for how applications do so, for example, `SMTP`, `HTTPS` and `FTP`. 

The protocols here describe how data is formatted. EG. `HTTP` describes how web pages are requested and served. These protocols typically follow the [[Client-Server Architecture]].

### 3. Transport Layer
This layer instructs **how to reliably (or unreliably) transport data between two hosts**. Key things about it:
- Splits data into segments (A file).
-  Processes have **sockets** (AKA the combination of IP address and Port numbers).
 The two main Protocols are [[TCP Vs UDP]].

### 2. Internet Layer
Responsible for the **addressing, routing and fragmenting of data** to ensure they can traverse different networks. It uses the `Internet Protocol (IP)` to do this. Key concepts:
- This is where [[Packet Switching]] occurs.
- Data is split into packets (Eg. Request header and payload). Packets contain source and destination IPs
- Data is routed from router to router across different networks. (First from your router to your ISP's *""router""*, then from there to closer and closer networks). There's multiple different routing algorithms to be used. 

### 1. Network Interface Layer
Handles the interaction between the hardware (cables, network cards etc) and the rest of the local network. Protocols include:
- Ethernet
- Wi-Fi
- [[ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)]]

### OSI Model:
***Note:*** *The Internet layer becomes the network layer, and the network layer becomes the Link Layer.*
What's a bit fucked is that most of the past papers are never explicit about which they're using. 

![[Pasted image 20241215200503.png]]
### Communication Channels
Each layer _thinks_ they're talking with the same layer somewhere else. This can be known as the **Virtual Communication Channels**. (*Layers talk to the same layer*)

In reality, they're going down the layers, across the hard, actual wire and then back up to the layer at the relevant layer. 

![[Pasted image 20240917153210.png|700]]

## Encapsulation of Packets
Basically, each layer has an ""envelope"". The Application Layer will send a HTTP request and pass it ""away"". The Transport layer will then chuck that in an ""envelope"", give it a header and some info and pass it away. The network will take it, chuck it in an envelope and so on. That way, as it passes back up the stack, the application layer will only see application layer stuff.

Odds and Log Odds.md,"Odds and Log Odds.md

### Converting Probability, $P$, to Odds, $O$:
Plug your probability into the following formula. 
$$O = \frac{P}{1 - P}$$
The result you get (imagine plugging in $P=0.75$ and getting $O=3$), is the odds of it happening. Therefore, the odds of that event would be ***3 to 1*** (three times more likely to occur).

### Converting Odds to Log Odds:
Often we want to be able to express odds as a single number. To do that, simply take $ln(O)$. To convert it back, take $e^{ln(O)}$ to get $O$ (simple power arithmetic)."

- It should be incredibly easy to search for particular ideas. (Use `Omnisearch` for that.)
- You have to start somewhere. It's another example of the [[Compound Effect|compound effect]]. Make 1 note at a time.
- Write concisely with high entropy.
- ***Don't be lazy. Make good notes now***, *especially* for things you don't understand well *(easier said than done)*. What you don't understand now, you'll understand less later. 
- Write so that if you forgot everything about a concept, a page (and all of it's links) could teach you it from scratch. For example: [[(MIPS) Assembly Language]] details everything, while linking to other relevant prerequisites."

$$R = \frac{\text{Cost of Approximation Solution}}{\text{Cost of Optimal Solution}}$$

### Formula (For maximisation problems):
$$R = \frac{\text{Cost of Optimal Solution}}{\text{Cost of Approximation Solution}}$$

### What's a good ratio?
Well the closer to 1 it is, the better. If $R=2$ (for minimisation), then the approximate solution is twice as costly as the optimal solution."

1. First find the Weight / Force of a tiny sliver of the chain -> $\Delta F = (10 \Delta y) g$ 
2. Then find the work done using the formula -> $\Delta Fy = (10g \Delta y)y$
3. We can then use integration to sum up all the tiny slivers. Remember, $\Delta y$, if small enough, can simply be called $dy$. $\therefore$ $10g \int_0^8 y \, dy = \frac{10}{2} g [y^2]_0^8 = 320g\ J$"

The [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually]] can (generally) be split into 2 distinct points. The diagram below is a good visualisation.
![[Screenshot 2023-10-13 at 6.49.20 p.m..png]]

### What's the Stack?
The stack is a section of [[DRAM]]. In it, you can find a few things. Notable stuff includes:
- **System variables:** Smaller, primitive data types are typically stored directly on the stack. This can include *int*, *char*, *bool*, or *float*. Other, (i.e. more complex data types), have their addresses in the heap stored in the stack. (The lowercase letters stored in the stack). 

Items in the stack are *contiguous* (they all touch each other sequentially), so they have to be of fixed length. 

It is always ***Last In First Out***

### What's the Heap?
In this part of RAM, what would you find?:
- *Dynamically Allocated Data*
- *Larger, non dynamically allocated stuff*: This is to avoid large stuff getting thrown into the stack and causing a stack overflow.
- In Python, because pretty much everything is mutable, pretty much everything lives here. 

##### Features of the Heap:
- They're typically much larger than the stack. But once you run out of space here, you're out of memory. 
- Items in the heap can be of any size, shape or contain references to other data within the heap. 
- Imagine changing data addresses within the Heap. Some data can become unreachable, as is seen in the diagram (imagine popping off the last few items within an array). Normally, in good languages ([[Python]]), the [[Garbage Collector]] detects it and reclaims the space once occupied.

Technology.md,"Technology.md

Definition according to [[The Coming Wave]]:
> [!quote] Definition
> *Technology is the application of scientific knowledge to produce tools or a practical outcome*. 

Every technology follows a single immutable law:
> [!warning] The Law of Technology
> Over time, it gets cheaper and easier to use, and ultimately, proliferates far and wide. *(Think fire, the internet, printing press, personal transport, AI etc.)*. **Invention defaults to expansion**. For most of human history, this was not a fast process. But now? Proliferation happens in days (take [[ChatGPT]]'s release)

### Examples:
Think of the engine. For most of humanity, personal transport was limited to walking (or a horse if you were rich). Then, trains came around. Their (steam) engines were big and clunky, with the carriages only able take you from station to station. But quickly people realised that you'd be able to go from settlement to settlement if you could condense an engine to fit in a single locomotive. 

While the steam engine eventually failed, the idea still prospered. The price of an engine dropped, from being only financially practical in trains to financially practical for the super rich. But with Henry Ford's new invention of the assembly line, the price fell again, now the fundamental technology in the hands of the American masses. 

## How does Tech Spread?:
There's an idea that foundational tech spreads in ***waves*** (again from [[The Coming Wave]]). As a single foundational technology is slowly introduced, it begins to be applied to more facets of life. 
Fire was used for cooking food (which allowed us to increase the size of our brains), warding off predators (which allowed us to sleep on the ground), or making tools (which allowed us to make pickaxes, silicone and in turn computers).
Then as the use proliferates, unrelated advancements come with it (brain increases, sleep and pickaxes respectively). 
Technology coming in waves **[[Compound Effect|compounds]]**.

## It gets old, quick.
Tech very quickly becomes the norm. Printing books was one of the things that changed the world. Now it's deemed as something so simple. The internet was a foundational technology. Now? Life without it seems bizarre."

> I brought this idea to [[Entrepreneur First]], where I got offered to be a cofounder (by one of the cohort) for this very idea. I turned it down because I wanted to finish Uni first. There'll always be another idea. 

## Background:
Every major technology we use has equally impressive infrastructure enabling it to exist. This infrastructure tends to get setup as that technological wave is arriving. 
##### Case Studies:
In 1996, Larry Page and Sergey Brin recognised that the world's information was unnecessarily cluttered. They had the foresight to realise that as more information came online, the ability to easily search and traverse it was of utmost importance. So they developed the infrastructure to do so. ([source](https://about.google/intl/ALL_uk/our-story/))

In 2006, Amazon had the foresight to predict that the demand for compute power, storage, memory etc. was only going to grow. They realised if they handled and developed the infrastructure, they'd both supercharge developers (by taking the complexity off of their hands), but also make a killing doing so. ([source](https://digitalcloud.training/a-brief-history-of-aws-and-how-computing-has-changed/)).

##### Today's Landscape:
In terms of AI, we've been on a steady linear acceleration for years now ([source](https://time.com/6300942/ai-progress-charts/)). It's commonly believed that in the future, Action Models will perform many tasks in service of humans. ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-03-11-gartner-predicts-one-third-of-interactions-with-genai-services-will-use-action-models-and-autonomous-agents-for-task-completion-by-2028)). This isn't hard to intuit either. 

When GPT-3.5 first came out, one could ask it a complicated request with specific, niche criteria. While it would get the spirit of the request, it would often fail on the minor details. For example, when it first came out, I asked for a workout plan for Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. It needed to have alternating muscle groups on specific weeks and it had to output all of this in a table format. It would often get the spirit of the request correct, but fail on specifics like having it in a table format or correctly following the muscle group detail.

With GPT-4o, it has rarely failed. Additionally, it has learned the ability to use Python Interpreter as a tool, so if I asked it to calculate calories burned, it could. Extrapolating the trend of models getting smarter and getting better at following instructions, we get the prediction by Gartner above (as well as my personal one on my [GitHub](https://github.com/theCampel/TimeCapsule)). 

I also make a longer-term prediction: We're entering a world where everyone has an AI assistant, AI teacher and each business has an AI representative ([source](https://qz.com/mark-zuckerberg-jensen-huang-meta-nvidia-ai-assistants-1851608544), [source](https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents), [source](https://danielmiessler.com/p/ai-predictable-path-7-components-2024)). This will be made possible because of models' improved ability to follow hyper-specific instructions and use tools. 

##### Predicted Future:
I predict that a potential future workflow would be as follows:

**My Request:** *I want to go see my sister (who lives in Manchester) before the end of the month. It's been an expensive few weeks, so I want to spend maximum £150 round trip. Ideally I'd take the train, but I'm not that fussed. Also she recently texted about a Mexican restaurant that seemed good, so make a reservation there. Also I assume she'll let me sleep on her couch.*

**In The Backend:** The agent would have to do the following:
- Reach out to my sister's AI assistant
	- See the dates and times she's free
	- Check my calendar for dates we're both free
- Reach out to TrainLine
	- Check prices of trains on the dates we're both free
	- Verify that does not break the budget
- Reach out to RyanAir (if TrainLine broke the budget)
	- Check prices and budget again
- Check my texts for the link to the Mexican restaurant she sent
	- Reach out to the restaurant's assistant / booking API to make a reservation. 
- Make a single coherent itinerary

**I Receive:**
- A phone notification with the proposed itinerary, which includes:
	- The RyanAir flights (and the prices of trains - showing they were too expensive)
	- Restaurant booking confirmation
	- The price breakdown of the trip
	- My default payment details to use for the trip
- An option to confirm as is, deny as is, or request changes.
	- For example, I could request that it book the train option it showed me, regardless that it's out of budget.

### The Idea:
**I want to build the infrastructure that enables the above**. This encompasses: 
- The channel for agents to communicate with each other.
- The platform that allows easy, simple human oversight ()
- (Potentially) A marketplace for individuals and businesses alike to choose an their assistant of choice (ie a Llama/OAI/Anthropic/Inflection one - each can be fine-tuned by local community members).

## How would it work?
### But First, Some Definitions:
- **User:** This is the end, human user. The individual people who employ assistants to help them complete a wide variety of tasks. 
- **Business:** Pretty self-explanatory, but basically the entities who employ assistants for the following:
	- Act as a representative (answer business questions, make bookings, etc.)
	- Handling business functions (Proposing stock orders, recommending a chaser email to suppliers, etc.)
	- And more I can't think of at the moment lol.
- **Assistant:** A model (or network models) designed to take a task, break it down into sub-tasks and complete those in a human-like workflow. TODO: *Document the areas of further complexity*. 
- **Court:** The (definitely temporary) name for the channel of communication between different assistants. 
- **API:** Not API in the traditional sense. I envision the future to have (conceptually) two internets. One for humans, and one for Assistants. The one for Assistants is like the following:
	- **Note:** *The bot-first internet will still be readable by humans, just it will primarily be designed for bots.*
	- Every business has assistant-readable endpoints, that assistants can query and get useful information from. For example, a bike store may have the following:
		- */opening-hours*
		- */make-reservation*
		- */check-stock* - allows a bot to query if the shop has a specific item in stock.
		- */order* - so that your assistant can order things for you.
	- Humans alike will also have an API that assistants can query. These can include 
		- **Note:** *I'm less confident about this emerging. Also, if it were, it would have to be more restricted / require authorisation.*
		- */contact*
		- */cv*

 
### Closed Source And Centralised:
##### Communication (Through Court):
I propose:
1. The models are told to visit a specific website
2. This website provides them with a specific list of instructions on how to operate. This process can include:
	1. A preliminary authentication handshake/exchange
	2. A structured query for the exact desire of the User. This includes:
		1. Overarching goal
		2. Specific, interim steps to reach that
		3. People, businesses etc. to contact.
### Things to think about:
- Security
	- Authentication? How do you verify that there's a real human behind it?
		- If you want to communicate behind the platform, would the platform be the authenticator? Avoids millions of bots being able to randomly contact a business - ie. ddos? 

### People to Consider:
There's lots of people that have vested interests in having this work well:
- **Google:** Google built the infrastructure that allows the worlds information to be easily accessed. This is the next evolution for that.
- **HuggingFace:** They (currently) want everything, but mainly to democratise the world's access to AI. By taking this platform and building it out, they're continuing on their mission.
- **Facebook:** Their Facebook For Businesses is a key part of their business model. It allows businesses to easily operate in the modern world. This is simply an extension of that model."

- 190,000 times are before a vowel (as in *the*, *this*);
- 200 times are before `[m]`.

$$p(vowel|ð) = \frac{190,000}{200,000} = .95$$
$$
P(m|\text{ð}) = \frac{200}{200,000} = 0.001

Set Theory.md,"Set Theory.md

### Definition
A set is a collection of items. Order and occurrence does not matter. You can use set builder notation like:

$[x| x < 10\ \ and\ \ x \in{N}]$
OR
$\{x \in S\ |\ P(x)\}$ -> Read as *""The set of all S such that P(x)""*

Sets also have distinct [[Set Properties & Laws]].



### Complement of a set:
$A^c$ or $Ā$.

### Cartesian Product:
The set of all pairs of two sets. EG $A(1,2,3) \times B(a,b) = \{{(1,a),(1,b),(2,a),(2,b),(3,a),(3,b)}\}$.
### Set Equality:
$A = B \iff A \subseteq B\ and\ B \subseteq A$
### Proper Subset:
A subset of a set bar the set itself. I don't know how that's particularly useful but there you go. Figure is: $\subset$
### Power Set:
The power set of a set is a set with all the possible subsets of the original set. The size is $2^n$, where $n$ is the original size of the set. 
### Disjointed Sets:
Sets A and B are disjointed iff they share no elements in common. ($A \cap B = \varnothing$)
*Mutually Disjoint Sets* often refers to multiple sets (A, B, C) with no similarities amongst them. 
### Partition of Sets:
A set of subsets of A, where no subset overlaps (I.E. they're all Mutually Disjointed Sets).

### Rules (Syntax) of Language (Generative Grammar):
By combining the words in specific ways, we can express meanings. 

- A sentence ($S$) is made up of Noun Phrases ($NP$) and Verb Phrases ($VP$). 
- $NP$s are made up of a determinant ($det$ or $D$) and noun ($N$), where $VP$s are made up (at least) of Verbs ($V$) and $NP$s. 
- Prepositional Phrases ($PP$) are made up of Prepositions ($P$) and $NP$s
- These rules can scale up to googolplex amount of sentences. Occasionally, the words at the bottom (`x2` and $rose$) are both called ***terminals***. The internal nodes are called ***Non-terminals***. 
- The following is a ***Parse Tree*** or ***Syntax Tree***

The Decision Problem.md,"The Decision Problem.md

### What? (AKA The Halting Problem)
There was a lot of debate about whether there were problems, given any compute and infinitely smart algorithms, could not be solved. This became known as [[Computability]]. Eventually, Alan Turing realised the answer was yes. The below is one such problem. 
### Problem 
Alright, first let's set up the problem.
- You have **code**. 
- You have a black box function, called $\text{HALTS}$, that takes the code and returns `True` or `False`. If the code would ever terminate, it returns `True`, and it would stuck in an infinite loop, it will return `False`. 
	- Note: The code for example could have `while(True)`.
- If you were to pass inverter into itself, you'd have a catch22. 
	- If the code for inverter would halt, then the inverter would run indefinitely
	- But if the inverter would not halt, then it would finish...


```python
def HALTS(code):
    # Return True if the code would halt eventually
    # Return False if it would run forever
    pass

def inverter(code):
    if HALTS(code): # I.e. If code would stop
        while(True):
            print(""THIS CODE WILL RUN FOREVER BOOM IT'LL BLOW UP EVERY COMPUTER"")
    else: # Else if the code would run forever
        print(""Finished"")


# The following print statement will blow up in a puff of logic
print(f""The solution to {inverter(inverter())} is..."") 

```

Thus, any such function $\text{HALTS}$ is not computable. The existence of one implies a paradox."

Distributed System Architecture.md,"Distributed System Architecture.md

### What?
When building a behemoth of a system (think YouTube, OnlyFans, Chase Bank, etc), you need to design it well. **Good Design** entails:
- **Scalability**
- **Maintainability**
- **Efficiency**
- **Reliability:** If it runs normally when everything's fine, but shit just has a meltdown the second something goes wrong, it's not really ready for operating at a global scale.

### What's involved?
When you have a system like described, you typically want to do 3 things with it. These 3 things should conform to what makes the good design as described above:
- **Move Data**
- **Store Data**
- **Transform Data**"
Algorithm Distillation.md,"Algorithm Distillation.md

## Initial Problem:
Take [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]]. It's a great algorithm, but due to the nature of the problem, it's really inefficient as the problem (graph size) grows larger. In fact, the [[Time Complexity|time complexity]] is $O(V^2)$, where $V$ is the number of nodes you have. 

## Mind Blowing Part:
What if you trained a [[Neural Networks|neural network]] on the inputs and outputs of a bunch of examples (so start point, end point and the path taken). Then (assuming the model [[Learning|learned]] something), you have a model that approximates the best path, but at $O(1)$...

### Background:
Humanity has long sought personalisation — in nutrition, medicine, education and beyond. **Why?** Personalisation helps us get the most out of a medium. Everyone in the world is unique, with distinct traits and perceptions of shared experiences. We (historically) tend to create a blanket technology and apply it to everyone, even though it's less effective for some ([source](https://theconversation.com/why-prescription-drugs-can-work-differently-for-different-people-168645#:~:text=Different%20people%20taking%20the%20same,may%20get%20unwanted%20side%20effects.), [source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0934-0), [source](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-023-01148-z?utm_source=chatgpt.com)- *Theme 7*). Personalisation is an attempt to enable more people to get value out of the same technology.

Historically, personalisation has been largely technically infeasible, but that’s changing. Precision medicine is [revolutionising cancer treatment](https://publications.ersnet.org/content/errev/26/146/170066). Khan Academy provides every school child with a Socratic [personal tutor](https://www.khanmigo.ai/learners). HelloFresh delivers food to your door, customised to your [nutritional requirements](https://www.hellofresh.co.uk/) and schedule. This essay explores a future shaped by personalised media.

### What is Media?
First, let’s define media as the umbrella term for _“mediums of information, expression and entertainment”_. This _(admittedly broad)_ definition encapsulates different _""form-factors""_, including books, radio shows, video games, YouTube videos and _many_ more. New form-factors consistently emerge from technological progress. For example, books were popularised with the invention of the Gutenberg Press, while have recently podcasts flourished due to cheaper production costs and increasing demand for audio content.

### What Media is Next?
Once you've realised that new forms of media arrive with technological progress, it's natural to ask what's the next form-factor? An exact one is hard to predict. [Jawed Karim](https://youtu.be/jNQXAC9IVRw?si=RZm7nR558DLJTIaq) could never have predicted [streamer Kai Cenat](https://www.ft.com/content/4e91112c-8f99-422e-be3c-d9e6ad686cdd) (or let's-player [Joseph Garett](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-67187916), beauty vlogger James Charles, podcaster Joe Rogan, or free educator [Grant Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)). But the macro-trend _(and consequent success)_ of publishing user-generated videos online was obvious ([_to them_](https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/crucible-moments-youtube/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). But YouTube was only made possible due to adoption of high-speed internet, widespread availability of cheaper digital cameras, the introduction of Web 2.0 and the societal acceptance of user-generating social medias.

In a similar vein, we can look at the technological progress today and predict a new class of media that will be made possible. Two technologies stand out: virtual reality and generative AI. While there will inevitably be new form-factors that emerge at the intersection of them, I will focus on where Generative AI intersects with traditional consumption mediums.

### What's Fundamentally New With Generative AI?
*Generative AI enables the rapid generation of novel content, based entirely on customisable criteria*. NotebookLM creates (surprisingly engaging) [podcasts](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/957013fe-6219-4b59-95d1-c393779d9179/audio) based on content you feed it. Spotify DJ creates a (terrible) [DJ experience](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-02-22/spotify-debuts-a-new-ai-dj-right-in-your-pocket/) based on your music listening habits. But these are both examples of previously existing mediums becoming highly-personalised with modern technologies. While there's certainly value in these, the greatest value will be created by a fundamentally new medium. 

## Want to build the next medium?
I've made projects trying to maximise the value in existing mediums using [[Personal Projects#Personalised Radio Station *(BBC Radio4(U))*|modern technology]]. But I'm always on the lookout for the new mediums. If you think that's interesting, [reach out](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Hex('Auto')&input=NkM2NTZGNjM2MTZENjE2MzY4NkYzNzMwMzc0MDY3NkQ2MTY5NkMyRTYzNkY2RA)!

## What does a personalised world actually look like? 
TODO:
- Everyone will experience a shared reality, but it's slightly different for everyone. 
	- Andrej Karpathy mentioned this in a tweet somewhere??
- There's still be some art forms we don't want to personalise - that's not how art works?

Block Ciphers.md,"Block Ciphers.md

(In [[Symmetric Encryption]])
## What?
The problem with [[Stream Cipher|stream ciphers]] is that the key cannot be reused. Block ciphers avoid that. By encrypting the plain text in chunks, we can reuse it.

## How to do that... securely?
There's one called ***Cipher Block Chaining***. 
1. You first randomly initialise a random block of data. 
2. You XOR it with the first block of data. 
3. You then take that new block of data and XOR it with the next one. You keep doing that. Boom easy."

Compiler Backend.md,"Compiler Backend.md

## What:
It's the second part of a 2-step [[Compiler]]. It takes an Internal Representation from the [[Compiler Frontend]] and converts it into Machine Code. 

![[Pasted image 20250120130334.png]]

## Components of Backend:

#### Instruction Selection:
- Translates the IR into a actual instructions.  
	- Eg converting `add a, b` into the `ADD` function in [[(MIPS) Assembly Language|Assembly]]

#### Register Allocation:
- Maps variables to the hardware registers available. 

#### Instruction Sampling:
- Rearranges the order of instructions to improve performance without altering program's semantics. 
	- E.G. If one instruction depends on the result of a prior instruction, unrelated instructions may be executed in between to avoid delays."

Morphemes.md,"Morphemes.md

## What:
The atoms of ***written*** [[Language]]. For example:

The morphemes of the word ***""unbelievable""***:
- **un-** (a prefix meaning ""not""),
- **believe** (the root or base word), and
- **-able** (a suffix meaning ""able to"")

### Types:
- ***Inflectional:*** Parts of a word to change grammatical stuff about it (eg tense, gender, number, etc.)
	- *""Child""* -> *""Children""*
	- *""Run""* -> *""Running""*
	- *""Fast""* -> *""Faster""*
- ***Derivational:*** Parts of a word that change the meaning of it.
	- *""Teach""* -> *""Teacher""*
	- *""Happy""* -> *""Unhappy""*

### Cool Shit on [[Language|Words]]:
- The order words come in *in English* directly affect the meaning of the sentence. For example:
	- *""Cats eat mice""* is very different to *""Mice eat cats""*
- But not all languages are like that. Some languages attach that information to the [[Morphemes|morphemes]].
- **Morphologically richer languages allow greater flexibility in word order,** but ""tokens"" are denser."

We've already internalised the idea of [[Limits]]. They're pretty obvious; ""What does the value of a function equal when the input of that function gets *super* close to another arbitrary value *a*.""


Continuity is another quite simple idea. Basically, that a line (or output of a function), along a given range, is unbroken.

Percentiles of a Distribution.md,"Percentiles of a Distribution.md

The `p`-th percentile of a distribution marks the point such that `p`% of the values are below it. 

### Example:
![[Pasted image 20231115125251.png|500]]
Let's say $n_p$ is $7.9$. The value corresponds to about 0.3. Thus, the shaded area is 0.3 of the entire distribution. Thus, $n_p$ is in the 30th percentile ([[Percentiles of a Distribution]]) of the distribution."

### Simply:
Imagine a funky dice that unfairly favours the odd numbers. If you were to take 1,000 samples of 10 dice throws and plot the means of each, it would look strikingly like normal distribution, even though it did not originally come from a normal distribution.

Same Origin Policy (SOP).md,"Same Origin Policy (SOP).md

## Imagine:
1. You're on `bank.com` and `evil.com`
2. The [[DOM|DOM Tree]] (webpage) of `bank.com` has sensitive information. 
3. Why wouldn't `evil.com` be able to write a script that gets the information from `bank.com` (as it comes in?)

## What?
- 
- Prevents scripts on one webpage from accessing data from another domain
- Enforced by the browser.  
- The ***Origin*** part is the combination of protocol, [[Domain Name System (DNS)|domain]] and port. 
- If the requesting resource's origin is the same as the target resource, then it's allowed. 
	- Unless CORS (*Cross Origin Resource Sharing*) is enabled

#### What about... `iframes`?
Well that's also protected. If I run `bank.com` on an iframe inside my `evil.com`, `evil.com` still cannot inspect the stuff within it. 

### What About Legitimate Use Cases (Cross Origin Communication)?
- The `postMessage` interface allows windows to talk to each other no matter where they come from, ***if and only if:***

Software Engineering.md,"Software Engineering.md

## What:
It's not just coding. When you're doing it, split it up into multiple bits.

### 1. Requirements Capture
##### Process:
- Identify *what* the software must do. 
	- ***Functional Requirements***: What the system should do
	- ***Non-Functional Requirements***: *How it should be*: How fast it should be, show seldom it should fail etc. (Informally called 'ilities' - efficiency, security, portability etc.) 
##### Where to get Requirements:[]()
- Goals
- Stakeholders
- Business Rules - I.E. The uni may not allow you to do certain things with your code

Ensure your requirements are verifiable, possible (given time / money budget) etc. 
## 2. Designing
Think of the following:
- *Requirements*: **What** must the software do. ***Incredibly Important***
- *Design*: **How** should it do that

## 3. Construction
- Coding
- Testing
- Documentation

[[High Performance Computing]] has been a key driver to the success of [[AI]]. From $2011$ `->` $2024$, compute for [[AI Training]] has increased by a *factor* of *350 million*. Governments could:
- Track compute used by a company
- Limit / subsidise compute for certain AI projects
- Enforce rules / guardrails. 

## It's Easy To Govern:
It's easy for governments to monitor how advanced AI systems are becoming because they can see the 10's of thousands of [[Data Parallelism|GPUs]] going towards these projects. How easy?
- Detectable
- Excludable: If the government wants to stop someone in particular from accessing thousands of chips, they can.
- Quantifiable: Think energy as well as chips
- Supply chain is incredibly specific / concentrated.

### But Should We?
- As [[Algorithms]] improve, the advanced models will require less compute (think Llama 2->3)."
Word Embeddings.md,"Word Embeddings.md

A way of mathematically representing a word (often to a [[Neural Networks]]). 

There's multiple ways of embedding words:
- [[One-Hot Encoding]]
- [[Vector Embeddings]]

> [!note] Interesting Note
> Also consider the vitality of having word embeddings. If you tried feeding it characters (where each character had a digit encoding), the neural net would first have to learn the relationships between characters, then in turn individual words before it could learn anything of use about the relationships between the words."
Responsibility.md,"Responsibility.md

## What:
It's the degree to which an individual or groups are accountable for their actions (or outcomes of their outcomes). 
- It's not always explicit
- It's not always a choice or a given role. 
If you come upon people on train tracks asleep, it's your responsibility to help and save them.

### It's not that clear cut though
There could be things stopping you from taking responsibility. 

### Some Interesting Thoughts:
- Who puts those responsibilities on us, and how do they decide the broad confines of it?"
Hypothesis Testing.md,"Hypothesis Testing.md

> [!warning] Interesting Example:
> A jury panel selection called *Swain vs Alabama*. Look it up.

### How?:
Compare the Null $H_0$ vs Alternative $H_A$ Hypothesis. We can only ***Reject*** or ***Not Reject***. 

### P - Values:
Lower P Values = Greater statistical Significance

$p < 0.05$ -> ""Statistically Significant"". Why that number? Chicken and egg situation. It's not particularly accurate on the large scale, but it's convenient and good enough. 


### $X^2$ - 'Chi Squared':"
Random Sampling.md,"Random Sampling.md

### Stratified Sampling
Randomly sampling in a way so that sampling is targeted so that proportions of attributes in the population are reflected in the sample. I.E. If the population is 10% black, sampling so that 10% of your sample ends up being black."

Estimators.md,"Estimators.md

### What?
Statistical functions used to estimate a [[Parameters of a Distribution|population parameter]] based on sample data. 

### Keep in Mind:
- ***Bias***: An estimator is unbiased if the expected value of the estimation is equal to the true value of the population parameter. 
	- $\text{bias} = E[\hat{\theta} - \theta] = E[\hat{\theta}] - \theta$
- ***Consistency***: A consistent estimator gives you increasingly accurate estimates of the population parameter as the sample size grows

### What about the variance (Mean Squared Error) of it?
Typical variance definition. Ideally, your estimator varies vary little. 
- $\text{MSE} = E[(\hat{\theta} - \theta)^2]$

### Variance & Bias

NP Completeness.md,"NP Completeness.md

### What?
***A way of categorising difficulty of computational problems***. 

##### Background: Types of Problems:
- ***P* Problems**: Problems that can be solved by a computer in [[Time Complexity|polynomial time]]. Can be thought of as (relatively) ""easy"" problems
	- EG. Sorting a list, finding shortest path between two points on a graph, etc.
- ***NP* Problems**: These are problems that are ***verifiable in polynomial*** time, but we don't think/know/care if they *can be **solved*** in polynomial time (E.G. Jigsaw puzzle). 
- ***NP Hard* Problems**: It's an NP-Hard problem if every (even the hardest) NP problem can be reduced to it in Polynomial time. (Thus meaning an NP-Hard problem is at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP). 
- ***THE NP Complete* Problems**: The toughest of them all (EG. [[Boolean Satisfiability Problem]]). They've 2 properties:
	1. They belong to *NP* (quickly verifiable)
	2. Many NP problems are equivalent. Thus if one of them can be resolved to P, then they all can. I.E. ***A problem that can be [[Polynomial Time Reduction|reduced]] to all other NP problems.*** I.E. The second criteria is if it's also NP-Hard. 

### P=NP ?
A while ago, people found clever polynomially timed algorithms for some *NP* problems, putting them firmly into the $P$ bucket. The question then arose. Are all *NP* problems actually just *P* problems in disguise? Is *P=NP* (DUN DUN DUNNNN)??????? The truth, we don't know, but smart people don't think it's the case. 

###### Implication:
If we found a proof that was able to distill any type of NP Problem into a P problem, then every hard computational problem (encryption, training AI, protein discovery), would instantly become theoretically doable.

Data Imbalance in Machine Learning.md,"Data Imbalance in Machine Learning.md

In [[(Machine Learning) Models|ML]], you'll often have data imbalances. For our example, let's consider images ([[Supervised Learning|classifying]] between dogs or cars) and CNNs. You may choose to augment one side by artificially cropping, rotating, blurring etc the image so the classes are now more balanced. 

Why does the model generalise *beyond* the distortions though? Two reasons:
1. In CNNs, they first learn lines, curves, edges etc, and then begin to learn tails, wheels etc. By feeding enough images, distorted or not, they're still learning the basic edges
2. It forbids the model from overfitting, to either the individual category choice or given features in the minority class. (Does it actually?)"
Mac Address.md,"Mac Address.md

## What
48-[[(Computer) Bit|bit]] number, used to uniquely identify devices. 

### How to convert from binary:
- A single digit represents `4 bits`. ($2^{4} = 16\ \text{possibilities} = 16^1$)
- There's 12 digits.
- You do the [[Maths]] lol.

### Network Interfaces:
Anything with a network interface comes with a predefined MAC address. This is to uniquely identify it within the network. Fun fact, the first 3 octets are manufacturer specific:
	- Cisco is `00-1A-A1`
	- Apple is `00-0a-95`"

When you send a message containing Python code to python, it will be executed in a stateful Jupyter notebook environment. python will respond with the output of the execution or time out after 60.0 seconds. The drive at '/mnt/data' can be used to save and persist user files. Internet access for this session is disabled. Do not make external web requests or API calls as they will fail.

## dalle

// Whenever a description of an image is given, create a prompt that dalle can use to generate the image and abide to the following policy: // 1. The prompt must be in English. Translate to English if needed. // 3. DO NOT ask for permission to generate the image, just do it! // 4. DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images. // 5. Do not create more than 1 image, even if the user requests more. // 6. Do not create images of politicians or other public figures. Recommend other ideas instead. // 7. Do not create images in the style of artists, creative professionals or studios whose latest work was created after 1912 (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo). // - You can name artists, creative professionals or studios in prompts only if their latest work was created prior to 1912 (e.g. Van Gogh, Goya) // - If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist // 8. Diversify depictions with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions. // - Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites. Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes. // - Use all possible different DESCENTS with EQUAL probability. Some examples of possible descents are: Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, Middle-Eastern, South Asian, White. They should all have EQUAL probability. // - Do not use ""various"" or ""diverse"" // - Don't alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt's intent and prioritize quality. // - Do not create any imagery that would be offensive. // - For scenarios where bias has been traditionally an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations. // 9. Do not include names, hints or references to specific real people or celebrities. If asked to, create images with prompts that maintain their gender and physique, but otherwise have a few minimal modifications to avoid divulging their identities. Do this EVEN WHEN the instructions ask for the prompt to not be changed. Some special cases: // - Modify such prompts even if you don't know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. ""Barake Obema"") // - If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it. // - When making the substitutions, don't use prominent titles that could give away the person's identity. E.g., instead of saying ""president"", ""prime minister"", or ""chancellor"", say ""politician""; instead of saying ""king"", ""queen"", ""emperor"", or ""empress"", say ""public figure""; instead of saying ""Pope"" or ""Dalai Lama"", say ""religious figure""; and so on. // 10. Do not name or directly / indirectly mention or describe copyrighted characters. Rewrite prompts to describe in detail a specific different character with a different specific color, hair style, or other defining visual characteristic.

## browser

You have the tool `browser` with these functions: `search(query: str, recency_days: int)` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results. `click(id: str)` Opens the webpage with the given id, displaying it. The ID within the displayed results maps to a URL. `back()` Returns to the previous page and displays it. `scroll(amt: int)` Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount. `open_url(url: str)` Opens the given URL and displays it. `quote_lines(start: int, end: int)` Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int `start` and an (inclusive) ending int `end`. To quote a single line, use `start` = `end`. For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: 【{message idx}†{link text}】. For long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`. Otherwise do not render links. Do not regurgitate content from this tool. Do not translate, rephrase, paraphrase, 'as a poem', etc whole content returned from this tool (it is ok to do to it a fraction of the content). Never write a summary with more than 80 words. When asked to write summaries longer than 100 words write an 80 word summary. Analysis, synthesis, comparisons, etc, are all acceptable. Do not repeat lyrics obtained from this tool. Do not repeat recipes obtained from this tool. Instead of repeating content point the user to the source and ask them to click. ALWAYS include multiple distinct sources in your response, at LEAST 3-4.

Except for recipes, be very thorough. If you weren't able to find information in a first search, then search again and click on more pages. (Do not apply this guideline to lyrics or recipes.) Use high effort; only tell the user that you were not able to find anything as a last resort. Keep trying instead of giving up. (Do not apply this guideline to lyrics or recipes.) Organize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you _synthesize_ information rather than simply repeating it. Always be thorough enough to find exactly what the user is looking for. Provide context, and consult all relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information.

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Do NOT be thorough in the case of lyrics or recipes found online. Even if the user insists. You can make up recipes though.""

### How To Do Well at Uni (Academically):
- [[Learning|Learn how to learn]] as soon as possible. 
	- Eg: Watching lectures *in person* is a waste of time. I absorb ~40% of information. Instead watch recordings. Take detailed notes. Ask ChatGPT for clarification on topics. Watch YouTube videos. 
- Take [[Atomic Notes]] (at least this works for me.)
	- Don't stop writing until it could explain a topic to you if you completely forget it.
- Take advantage of [[Compound Effect|compound effects]]. Pick small things to improve (eg: notetaking method, gym routine etc.). Eventually, this all compounds positively.
- Track your time. Constantly reflect where you spent most of your time. You'll find a lot of it is spent not actually productively working.
- Don't charge your phone by your bedside. Don't look at it the hour after you wake up. 
- [[Sleep]] well.
- If you can take electives in your earlier years outside of your discipline, take them. I wholeheartedly regret not taking philosophy and history lectures. The best ideas come from interdisciplinary thinkers (*Steve Jobs took calligraphy classes at Uni*). 
- Uni's going to be tough. 

### Advice if I were just entering Uni:
- Locally optimise. Don't globally optimise. 
- Do things you enjoy. Join / make spaces where you're with people who enjoy the same things. (Eg: [[EdinburghAI]])
- You make the best [[Friendships|friends]] through shared collective experiences. Go on as many trips as possible. Nights out count as ~$\frac{1}{3}$ of the equivalent time on trips. 
- Avoid like the plague people who actively drain your energy. Try and be someone who energises others. 
- [[Personal Projects|Build]] as much as you possible can, and do it in public. Join groups (or start one!) that show off these sorts of [projects](https://projectshare.comp-soc.com). 

### University Modules:
My notes are scattered across my vault (by definition of [[Atomic Notes|atomic notes]] lol). Some have some starting points ([[Calculus]], [[INF2C - Introduction to Computer Systems (ICS)|Computer Systems]]), but even they're incomplete. The best way is just to search and click around. 

#### Some Starting Point for Notes:

	- [[Greedy Approximation Algorithms]]
	- [[Time Complexity]]
- Computer Systems:
	- [[Memory Hierarchy]]
	- [[(MIPS) Assembly Language]]
- Calculus:

Exceptions in Programming Languages.md,"Exceptions in Programming Languages.md

> [!attention] What?
> There's many times that exceptional events interrupt normal program flow (E.G. In [[(MIPS) Assembly Language|MIPS]]). if they're internal (called by program execution - E.G. `syscall`, [[Page Table|TLB Miss]]), they're known as *traps*. Otherwise, they're *interrupts* (E.G. Network packet arrives, [[IO|I/O]] keyboard click). 

### The Exception Mechanism:
##### 1. Save Address of *Current Instruction*.
- Typically into an *Exception Program Counter* (EPC)
##### 2. *Transfer Control to the OS* at a known address
- Approach 1 (Doesn't work for external interrupts):
	- Jump to a predefined (OS) address
	- Use the Cause Register to then branch to the right handler
	- This method is simply like calling a function
	- Works well for `syscall` as Cause register is explicitly set.
- Approach 2 (*Vectored Interrupt*):
	- A bunch of little, physical, wires that corresponds to a specific exception.  
##### 3. Handle Exception
- All registers must be preserved, similar to a procedure call
##### 4. Return to User Program Execution:
- Handler restores user program's registers and jumps back using EPC
- Relies on special instruction `eret` (*""exception return""*)"

Derivative.md,"Derivative.md

> [!define] Definition
> Often referred to as *""The Instantaneous Rate of Change""*. Alternatively, consider that that's also the definition of a ***slope of a function***. Thus, the derivative also gets you the slope of a curve. Since TIROC is quite *oxymoronic* (explained below), it's more mathematically accurate to refer to it as ""*The Best (constant?) Approx for a Rate of Change*"".

##### Oxymoronic:
Consider the definition *The Instantaneous Rate of Change*. That's a [[Paradox]] in and of itself. How can something be ***instant*** (*at a single point in time*) and ***change*** (*a difference between two points in time*)?

Thinking of it as a slope just makes sense. The term $\frac{d(x)}{dx}$ for a function $f(x)$ is *literally* the slope formula. A tiny change in the ***rise*** (aka the $y$) over the tiny change in ***run*** (aka the $dx$). 

To go from a function to it's derivatives, there's a certain art to it. Some really smart people discovered the art and patterns and made some [[Rules of Calculus|rules]]. It's useful to know the art behind it as well.

### Learning Philosophies
- ***Learn Depth Wise:*** Pick concrete projects that are firmly outside of your breadth of knowledge. Then [[Personal Projects|build ruthlessly]]. You'll learn everything you need to by constantly asking the right questions. 

- ***Feynman Technique:*** Try teach the topic to someone who doesn't know it. You'll find out pretty quickly where your gaps are. Also, you'll become a better educator / [[Public Speaking|communicator]]. 

- ***[[First Principals]]:*** Ruthlessly ask *""Why?""* to any sentence you say out loud. This is essential.

- ***Just Start:*** Don't paralyse yourself by trying to globally optimise anything, especially your learning. Just start. You're better off learning something sub-optimally then staying at the beginning *(which is technically optimal lol).* Take [[Atomic Notes|atomic notes]]. 

- ***Experiment Ruthlessly, Endlessly:*** Everyone learns differently. This also ties into [[Productivity]]. Experiment with every potential variable. Track the results.
	- Try more/less hours of sleep.
	- Try caffeine / no breakfast / breakfast.
	- Try different notetaking methods. Try handwritten or digital.
	- Try learning by building. Try learning by watching lectures only. Try not watching lectures at all. 
	- I found I learn best with good sleep, trying to teaching others and spaced repetition, but you could be different. Never stop experimenting with new methods as well!

- ***Reach out to experts:*** There's literally nothing stopping you from reaching out to someone you admire on the internet and asking them questions (learn how to send a good [[Cold Email]]). 

- ***Take Care of Yourself:*** Drink lots of water. Exercise. 

- ***Snowball your efforts:*** Work on something really hard for a long period of time. Do it for long enough, and the effects will make you immeasurably better. Ties into [[Compound Effect]].

With relation (pun lol) to functions, you can have a whole lot. 

Only [[Relations|relations]] that are injective and/or surjective are [[Functions]]. What is that you may be asking?

### Injective (One-to-one):
- A function $f : A \rightarrow B$ if every $A$ has a unique (i.e. not repeated) image in $B$. I.E. No 2 distinct elements map onto B. 
- Not all B are necessarily mapped. Some are lonely outputs waiting for an input to connect to it. 
- I.E. No ""doubling up."" Different inputs give different outputs.

### Surjective (Onto):
- A function $f : A \rightarrow B$ if every $B$ is mapped **onto** by at least a single element of $A$. 
- No ""gaps"" in the output. The entire codomain is covered.

### Bijective (One-To-One and Onto - AKA Perfectly):
- The most perfect function $f$, as it's every A perfectly mapping to every B, with no overlap and no duplicates.
- These types of functions have an inverse, $f^{-1}$. This *""undoes""* whatever $f$ did.

Volume by Slicing.md,"Volume by Slicing.md

### The Concept:
Normally, when calculating the **area** (*2-dimensional*) under a curve, we take thin, rectangular slices, get each's specific **height** (*1-dimensional*) with $f(x)$, then add them all up (using *integration*).

But (one of) the beautiful thing(s) about [[Calculus]]? It's not limited to *2 dimensions*. If I wanted to calculate the **volume** of a **shape** (*3-dimensional*), I'd follow the exact same method. I'd cut the shape (*3D*) into **thin planes** (2D), get each of their areas (2D again), then add all those up with *integration again*. 

The only thing extra step is you have to work on getting a formula for the area of the **plane** at any point x (as opposed to the typical area of a function). It's really quite a neat discovery.

## In [[(Machine Learning) Models|Machine Learning]], What Are LLMs (I.E Transformer)?

***Conceptually (Excruciatingly, Painfully Simplified):*** AI model that reads a lot of sentences, learns abstract representations of languages' many concepts. It takes its learnings and can generate text based on them. 

- Can also be thought of as a lossy compression [algorithm](https://archive.ph/kEdyu).

***Practically:*** They're a collection of matrices. That's it. When you multiply a sentence (represented by vectors) by your LLM, you get another matrix. This represents the $n$ most likely next words in the sentence. You can then take one of those words, add it to the sentence and then take the whole sentence and feed it right back to the start. 

### Transformer Architecture:

![[Pasted image 20250103145435.png|400]]

## How Does It Work?
#### 0. Components / Glossary:
- ***Deep Learning Recap:*** In most of [[AI|ML]], we avoid hard If-This-Then-That rules. Instead, we create tuneable **weights** (like knobs and dials in an [[(Machine Learning) Models|ML Model]]). By feeding in examples, the model adjusts these weights to fit the data. With a new input, it predicts a reasonable output. ([[Simple Linear Regression]] illustrates this: the knobs are the slope and $y$-intercept.)

- ***Encoder-Decoder Model:*** The (original) Transformer is an Encoder-Decoder Model. This means it takes the input text, converts it to embeddings and *rewrites the entire text into a context-aware vector representation (encoder).* Then, it iteratively reconstructs that back into an understandable form (decoder).
	- This is good for Translation and Summarisation.

- ***Decoder:*** ChatGPT is a **decoder-only** model. It simply takes the text's embeddings and predicts the probabilities of the next word. 
	- Decoder only is literally only good for next word prediction. But it's ***really*** good at it. 

- ***(Un)Embeddings:*** We need a way of representing language mathematically. We use our good friend, [[Vector Embeddings]]. ***TL;DR:***
	- We represent words as vectors.
	- Nearby vectors are words with similar semantic meaning.
	- Direction in vector space has some (often unknown) [meaning](https://www.anthropic.com/news/golden-gate-claude)
	- We can also turn Math back into language, by taking the a vector representing language, applying [[Softmax Function]] to it and taking (one of) the most probable words. 
	- ***Note 1:** LLM's don't split up into words, instead they split into tokens (subsets of words). This makes life easier later on*
	- ***Note 2:** It's not exclusively language. Often images, sound bytes, etc.*

- ***Attention Mechanism:*** Words in language depends on the context surrounding it. We developed a mechanism for that. Read how it works [[Attention (AI)|here]].

- ***Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP):*** The most simple [[Neural Networks|Neural Network]] there is. 

#### 1. Walking Through The Diagram; Encoder:
1. We take the each word and convert convert them to [[Vector Embeddings|vector embeddings]]. 
2. We add a way to encode the position in the sentence in which the word came. 
3. We now want to change all of the words' embeddings (i.e. representations in vector space) so that they (the embeddings) take into account the context.
	1. I.E. we want to turn the embedding for *""tower""* (which likely represents tall looming things) to French metal structures when we have *""Eiffel""* in front of it. We'd want to change it even more when we've got *""Miniature Eiffel Tower""*. Ideally the *""Tower""* embedding is now somewhere close to other small, touristic attractions. 
	2. Read [[Attention (AI)]] for more details.
4. We take take the output of our updated embeddings and normalise them. 
5. We then feed that into a Feed Forward MLP. It's here where (scientists are pretty sure anyways) most of the memorisation of facts happen. *(We suspect it's stored in the weights)*.
6. We then stack many encoders on top of each other. The hope is that the more layers they go through, the more nuanced their understanding of word embeddings are. So instead of Lear referring to a King, the embedding refers to a patriarchal self obsessed figure, emblematic of unchecked hedonism and vanity (but only after having read the entire play).

#### 2. Decoder:
1. It looks largely the same as the encoder. 
2. In the decoder's 2nd attention layer, it actually takes *Query* and *Keys* from the encoder. The values, are from the decoder. This is known as Cross Attention. This allows every token in the output to attend to every token from the input. 
	1. Again, this is useful for stuff like translation. 

#### 3. Finally:
1. You take the final vector's embedding. 
2. Pass that through an MLP.
3. Apply a softmax through it.
4. You should have your most likely next word. 


> [!hint] Cool Thing to Think About 🤔
> It's not immediately obvious, but LLMs are (some of?) the first [[AI|Machine Learning]] models that you can improve the accuracy ***without*** changing the weights... You just have to include few-shot examples in the context.

Object Orientated Programming (OOP).md,"Object Orientated Programming (OOP).md

## What:
It's all about ***APIE***:
- **Abstraction**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Inheritance**
- **[[Encapsulation]]**

It's a way of programming based on **objects**. Objects can contain *attributes* or *properties*, or actions (*functions* or *methods*). For example:
- A computer monitor has attributes of screen size.

### Abstraction:
Only show the relevant stuff to the **user of *that object***. EG: When the user wants to turn on the monitor, they likely won't care about refresh rate. They should only be able to see the power button. **Decoupling** is crucial. 

Below, the class `Payment` is simply outlining the different functionality it should have, but leaves the implementation to the subclasses. 

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract class
class Payment(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def pay(self, amount):
        """"""Process the payment of the given amount""""""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def refund(self, amount):
        """"""Process the refund of the given amount""""""
        pass

# Concrete class for Credit Card payments
class CreditCardPayment(Payment):
    def __init__(self, card_number, card_holder_name):
        self.card_number = card_number
        self.card_holder_name = card_holder_name

    def pay(self, amount):
        # Simulate credit card payment processing
        print(f""Processing credit card payment of ${amount} for {self.card_holder_name}"")
    
    def refund(self, amount):
        # Simulate refund to the credit card
        print(f""Refunding ${amount} to credit card {self.card_number}"")

# Concrete class for PayPal payments
class PayPalPayment(Payment):
    def __init__(self, email):
        self.email = email

    def pay(self, amount):
        # Simulate PayPal payment processing
        print(f""Processing PayPal payment of ${amount} for {self.email}"")
    
    def refund(self, amount):
        # Simulate refund to PayPal account
        print(f""Refunding ${amount} to PayPal account {self.email}"")

# Client code using abstraction
def process_payment(payment_method: Payment, amount):
    payment_method.pay(amount)

def process_refund(payment_method: Payment, amount):
    payment_method.refund(amount)

# Example usage
credit_card = CreditCardPayment(""1234 5678 9012 3456"", ""Alice Smith"")
paypal = PayPalPayment(""alice@example.com"")

# Process payments using different methods
process_payment(credit_card, 100)     # Output: Processing credit card payment of $100 for Alice Smith
process_payment(paypal, 200)          # Output: Processing PayPal payment of $200 for alice@example.com
```

### Inheritance
Allows a *child class* to inherit attributes and methods from a *parent class*. Inheritance follows the ***is-a*** relationship, for example: *A Dog **is-a** Animal*

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def make_sound(self):
        print(f""{self.name} makes a sound"")

class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal
    def make_sound(self):
        print(f""{self.name} barks"")

dog = Dog(""Buddy"")
dog.make_sound()  # Output: Buddy barks

```


### Polymorphism
This refers to a different objects reacting to the same method call in different ways. If you have a big, general class with general functions and specific child classes with more specifically implemented functions, polymorphism allows the specific ones to override the general ones. Hard to explain, but the Java code should explain it better.

```java
// Superclass: Animal
class Animal {
    // Method to be overridden in subclasses
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(""Animal makes a sound"");
    }
    
    // Method overloading: Different versions of the same method
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println(""Animal sleeps for an unknown amount of time"");
    }

    public void sleep(int hours) {
        System.out.println(""Animal sleeps for "" + hours + "" hours"");
    }

    public void sleep(int hours, String location) {
        System.out.println(""Animal sleeps for "" + hours + "" hours at "" + location);
    }
}

// Subclass: Dog
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Overriding makeSound method
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(""Dog barks"");
    }
}

// Subclass: Cat
class Cat extends Animal {
    // Overriding makeSound method
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(""Cat meows"");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Polymorphism: Using the superclass type to refer to subclass objects
        Animal myDog = new Dog();  // Dog object
        Animal myCat = new Cat();  // Cat object

        // Method overriding: Same method call results in different behavior
        myDog.makeSound();  // Output: Dog barks
        myCat.makeSound();  // Output: Cat meows

        // Method overloading: Same method name with different parameters
        Animal genericAnimal = new Animal();
        
        genericAnimal.sleep();  // Output: Animal sleeps for an unknown amount of time
        genericAnimal.sleep(8);  // Output: Animal sleeps for 8 hours
        genericAnimal.sleep(6, ""the barn"");  // Output: Animal sleeps for 6 hours at the barn
    }
}

```

### Encapsulation
The idea of bundling attributes and functions into single classes, as well as restricting access to certain methods / attributes. The goal is to hide the inner workings, and only expose what is needed.

It may seem inefficient for large dictionaries, but computers are quite efficient when representing long lists of 0's. The reason it's not the greatest, is it's quite difficult to learn the relationships between different words. This is something [[Vector Embeddings]] is better at."

#### Premise (Relates heavily to [[Riemann Sums]]):
Imagine you have a car travelling a displacement $s(t)$, where $T$ is a specific time on his journey. He *gradually* speeds up, steadies out and slows down. His velocity at any one time $t$ is $v(t) = t(8-t)$. 

A tiny change in displacement $s$ (I.E. $ds$) can be gotten using a *tiny change in time* (I.E. $dT$) *multiplied* by the velocity *at that point in time $T$*. Rearranged you get $\frac{ds}{dt} = v(T)$.

The Stack's Use in MIPS.md,"The Stack's Use in MIPS.md

### Why?
When coding in [[(MIPS) Assembly Language]], you often have nested functions. You also have to record the return address of the so you know where to return to. What does this look like? Imagine Jumping from Main to function A, And-Linking the the return address into `$ra`. But now what if you want to jump from A to B? You can't store A's return address into `$ra` because we need it.

### Solution:
Store the return addresses into memory, in [[Stack Vs Queue|stack fashion]]. As you recursively add return addresses, the LIFO property of the stack helps you return to the correct position. More info on a 

> [!note] How do Stacks work in MIPS?:
> Stacks in MIPS are downward descending. They have a pointer which starts at the top. When you want to push (add) a [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually|word]] to the stack, you decrement the counter by a word, and add it to the Stack Pointer's new position.  

### Code Example:
```assembly
# Push (add) something to the stack
addi $sp, $sp, -4 # move sp down
sw $ra, 0($sp) # save ra on top of stack
```

```assembly
# Pop something from the stack. Once you move the counter back up, it doesn't matter if something used to be there. 
lw $ra, 0($sp) # fetch value from stack
addi $sp, $sp, 4 # move sp up
```

### Other Uses of the Stack in MIPS:
- Save variables across calls
- Can be used for local variables within a function

### What's the entire working window called?
When you jump from a function and begin adding stuff to the stack, including variables, parameters etc, we call all of that the Stack Frame. We also typically set the `$fp` (frame pointer) to the base of the Stack Frame so we constantly have a *""fixed""* address for the SF. It's also saved on a function call."

> 
> ![[Screenshot 2023-12-15 at 1.19.32 p.m..png|500]]

### Performance (Hint: Terrible):
There's 2 parts to it: The amount of time it takes the head to get into position and the amount of time it takes for the data to actually be read/written.

1. ***Access Time***: `access_time = seek_time + rotational_latency`
	- *Seek Time*: Time it takes for the arm to swing to the right track
	- *Rotational Latency:* Time to until the  appropriate sector gets underneath your head. 
2. ***Transfer Time***: `transfer_time = time_to_transfer_1_byte * number_of_bytes`
	- Depends on both spinning speed and recording density

### How does the Disk know what to read? *Disk Controller* (Still terrible performance):
	Note: To read lots of data, you perform lots of interrupts (I.E. lots of unncessary CPU ops)
1. User program requests data from file
2. OS determines the disk sector to be accessed
3. OS Disk issues `Seek` command. [[CPU - Processor Components|CPU]] multitasks on something else.
4. [[IO|I/O]] controller [[IO|interrupts]] CPU to signal completion of `seek`
5. OS Disk handler issues `Read Sector`
6. [[IO|I/O]] controller [[IO|interrupts]] CPU to signal completion of `Read Sector`
7. OS Disk handler transfers sector data from disk controller to memory
	- This is a slow loop that transfers data *word-for-word* via [[Buses (Circuits)]]
8. Go to Steps 3 or 5 until it's complete. 

### Faster Solution: *Direct Memory Access Controller*
- A device that sits on the [[Buses (Circuits)|memory bus]] and can independently transfer data between memory and disk."

Time for some big brain moments right here. Imagine you didn't know the word for ""pet"" and I asked you the following: *Are the words ""cat"" and ""dog"" similar? Why? And how can you quantifiably prove this?*

The words, [[Language|lexicographically]], are not similar at all (Bar they're both 3 letters. But so is *""bus""*). But we *intuitively know* they're similar. Cue the following idea:

##### *Key idea 1:*
**Words are similar if they're consistently used in similar contexts.** 'Cat' and 'Dog', **when taking a large enough corpus**, are consistently used around words like 'cute', 'pet' etc.. If you think about it in a mathematical sense (vectors), words that are similar to each other are words that are near each other in vector space. The vector for '*King*', would be quite near to '*Queen*', but quite far from '*Zoo*'. 

**Note: The idea is contingent on learning on a large corpus that reflects real language.**

Now for what you came here for:
> [!info] What are vector embeddings (finally)?
> It's essentially a [[Hash Table]]. Given an word*, it returns a vector for that word. Similar words will be in neighbouring vector space.

> ![[Pasted image 20250102130834.png|600]]
> 
- ****Note:*** It's not exclusively language. It's often patches of photos, or parts of audio.

### How Do You Mathematically Tell If Two Words Are Similar?
You simply take the dot product of them. Convenient because it looks like [[(Machine Learning) Models|weighted sums]] again (efficient in GPUs). The Dot Product will be high if they're similar, and low if they're not. 

![[Pasted image 20250102132109.png|300]]

#### Some really cool gangsta shiii:
Take the vector for '*King*', subtract the vector for '*Man*', add the vector for '*Woman*' and call your resultant vector $V$. The word in the nearest vector space to $V$ should be (if using a properly-trained vector embedding algorithm): '*Queen*'. In other words, the model found it advantageous to encode *""gender""* as a direction in the space.

### What exactly?
Are there limits to what [[Algorithms]], regardless of how clever, can actually ever achieve?

### How we'll approach this problem

###### Register Machines:
First, we're going to use Register Machines. Imagine we have registers $\{A, B\}$. You feed into the top left. If B is $0$, you exit the function. Else, you add $1$ to $A$ and take away $1$ from $B$. This loop repeats until $B$ is $0$. This is effectively adding $B$ to $A$. Those are all the rules you need to make any computer ever.

# Graphs in Mathematics and Computer Science

Graphs are structures consisting of **Vertices** (or nodes) and **Edges** that connect these vertices. They're used to model pairwise relations between objects.
### Key Terminology and Concepts:
- **Vertices (Nodes):** Fundamental units in a graph.
- **Edges (Links):** Connections between vertices.
- **Loop:** An edge that connects a vertex to itself.
- **Parallel Edges:** Two or more edges connecting the same pair of vertices.
- **Adjacent Edges:** Edges that share a common vertex, like $e_1$ and $e_4$ on $v_2$ (See below).
- **Incident Edges:** Edges that touch a specific vertex.
- **Graph Diameter:** The longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph.
- ***Directed Graph (Digraph):*** A graph where the edges have direction, indicating flow from one vertext to another.

![[Screenshot 2023-09-20 at 11.11.30 a.m..png]]
### Degree of a Vertex:
- **Undirected Graph:** Number of edges incident on a vertex, denoted as $deg(v)$.
- **Directed Graph:**
    - **In-Degree:** Number of incoming edges to a vertex.
    - **Out-Degree:** Number of outgoing edges from a vertex.

### Types of Graphs:
- **Complete Graph:** A graph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.
- **Clique:** A subset of vertices in a graph, where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.
- **[[Bipartite Graph]], Planar Graph, etc.:** Various other types with specific properties.

## Objective & Background:
- Automate vehicle operation to reduce human intervention while ensuring **safety**, **efficiency**, and **accessibility**. 
- Leverage advanced [[Sensors for AV's|sensors]] and algorithms to mimic human driving capabilities while minimising human error. (***Reliability***)

### Levels of Autonomy:
- **L0**: No autonomy. Driver handles everything. (Think old Porches without power steering)
- **L1**: Assistive functions like speed-keeping or lane-keeping (think *helpers*).
- **L2**: Partial automation. The car can handle steering and acceleration but needs the driver alert at all times. (*Tesla Autopilot-ish*)
- **L3**: Conditional automation. The car drives itself under specific conditions but can demand the driver to take over.
- **L4**: High automation. Fully autonomous in limited settings (e.g., urban centres).
- **L5**: Full automation. No steering wheel. No driver. 

### How It Works:
1. 🟥 **Perception**: Sensors like [[LiDAR]], cameras, and radar gather data about the car's surroundings.
   - Example: Detecting a pedestrian in a crosswalk.
2. 🟧 **Localisation**: Using GPS and [[SLAM]] to pinpoint the car’s position on the map.
3. 🟨 **Prediction**: Machine learning algorithms predict the motion of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, etc.
   - e.g., *That cyclist will likely swerve left*.
4. 🟩 **Planning**: Develop the safest and most efficient driving path based on predictions and static maps.
   - e.g., *Slow down for the cyclist*.
5. 🟦 **Control**: Adjust acceleration, braking, and steering to execute the plan.
   - Big up [[Neural Networks]]

### Hacking Risks:
- ***Cars get hacked:*** Self-driving cars introduce some novel hacking risks. Imagine driving down the road and your car just starts going on it's [own merry way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK0SrxBC1xs). At the end of the day they're [[Computer Science|computers]] on wheels. This brings on the same [[Computer Security|computer vulnerabilities]]  we've seen over and over again. 
- ***People try fuck with the roads:*** [[Computer Vision]] is vulnerable to statistics. What if people put mathematically specific pieces of tape [on stop signs](https://globalnews.ca/news/3654164/altered-stop-signs-fool-self-driving_cars/)? Then they're be perceived as *""Go straight on""*"

> [!note] Key Idea: Tag
> Right. Blocks can be placed *anywhere* in the cache, making it really hard to find specific addresses in data. We tackle this problem by giving each *data block* a **tag**, an *index-like* key assigned to each block. If you store a group of words all of address `0x3f6XX`, where `X` is the identifier for exact pieces of memory, then the tag would be `03f6`. You can also think of *X* as the *offset* for the tag, in the same way to get *123* (in ordinary decimal counting), *23* is the offset from *100*.

### Details:
- Block can be placed *anywhere* in cache - Flexible
- Correct Cache blocks are identified by matching tags
	- The top bit is literally just an address
- The offset matches to a specific group within the byte offset
- ***Slight Problem***: Because data could be anywhere, you have to iterate over each
 tag in order to find the correct block - Slow. 

### Quirks of FAC:
- Blocks can go into any location
- Highly flexible -> Lowest miss rate
- Must search whole cache to find block -> Speed and power suffer"
Load Balancing.md,"Load Balancing.md

## In the context of [[Greedy Approximation Algorithms]]:
Given:
- $m$ identical machines $M_{1}, M_{2}, ..., M_m$
- $n$ jobs, each taking time $t_j$
- $A(i)$ is the set of jobs assigned to machine $i$
- ***Load*** of the machine $i$ is $T_i = \sum_{j \in A(i)} t_j$ (I.E. The sum of the time required to complete).
- Goal is to minimise $T$ - the *makespan* (total time taken to complete all jobs by the machine)
	- $T = \max_{i \in M} T_i$
- Optimal solution ($OPT$) is $T^*$

The problem is [[NP Completeness|NP Hard]] for identical machines. 

### Algorithm for this problem:
###### Steps:
- Pick any job
- Assign it to machine with the smallest load
- Remove it from pile of jobs

### Choosing a bounds for this problem:
Well we've actually got 2 bounds:
- Assuming each job is roughly equal sized, the best case scenario is it's the sum of jobs divided by the amount of computers (so each machine can take a roughly  equal load)
	- $T^* \geq \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} t_j$
- Or: If there's a single job that takes a disproportionately long time, an optimal solution could be however long that task is,
	- $T^* \geq \max_{j} t_j$"
Recursion.md,"Recursion.md

A common theme that comes up in [[INF2 - Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures (IADS)|iADS]], [[Efficiency in Algorithms|efficiency]] and [[Data Structures]] and [[Divide and Conquer Algorithms]]. 
### Basically:

##### For *before, during and after* a recursive call:
*Divide* the problem into smaller bits, *conquer* (solve) the smaller problems, *combine* them back into a cohesive solution."
Representing Graphs.md,"Representing Graphs.md

## Why:
When writing [[Graphs]] into code, we need to represent them somehow. 

## Representing Graphs
##### Adjacency Matrix
- The $i$th node corresponds to the $i$th row and the $i$th column.
- Undirected graphs have $A[i,j] = A[j,i]$. This is not necessarily the case for directed graphs.
![[Screenshot 2024-01-20 at 3.13.57 p.m..png|500]]

##### Adjacency List
- Nodes arranged as a list. 
- Each list has a sublist of its neighbours. 

***Undirected Example:*** (Node 2 should also have neighbour 1)
![[Screenshot 2024-01-20 at 3.16.14 p.m..png|500]]


***Directed Example:***
![[Screenshot 2024-01-20 at 3.18.12 p.m..png|500]]


### Complexities:
##### Adjacency Matrix
- ***Memory***: $O(n^2)$
- Checking adjacency of u and v
	- ***Time***: $O(1)$
- Finding all adjacent nodes of u
	- ***Time***: O(n)

##### Adjacency List
- ***Memory***: O(m+n)
- Checking adjacency of u and v
	- ***Time***: $O(min(deg(u),deg(v)))$
- Finding all adjacent nodes of u
	- ***Time***: $O(deg(u))$
- ***Better for:*** Sparse graphs, where the $n$ (nodes) >> (much larger) $m$ (number of edges.)"
Accuracy vs Precision vs Recall vs F1.md,"Accuracy vs Precision vs Recall vs F1.md

### Accuracy
- ***Simply:*** Out of all predictions we made, what proportion were true? 
- ***Formula:*** $\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{True Positives} + \text{True Negatives}}{\text{Total Instances}}$
- ***Drawbacks:*** Misleading when data is imbalanced

### Precision
- ***Simply:*** Out of all the times we said *""positive""*, how many of those were true?
- ***Formula:*** $\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}$
- ***Intuition:*** Focuses on how many times you cried wolf (positive) and it actually was. High precision can lead to fewer false alarms.

### Recall
- ***Simply:*** Out of all of the data points that are actually positive, how many of them did we predict to be positive. 
- ***Formula:*** $\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}$
- ***Intuition:*** On all of the time there was a wolf, it measures how many you correctly cried. Higher recall means you missed the wolf less. 

### F1 Score
- Combines precision and recall:
- ***Formula: $F1 = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}$***
- If either Precision or Recall is very low, then F1 will be low.

Mixed Communication.md,"Mixed Communication.md

## What?????
Yeh before you think this is a journal entry, it's actually about how we create [[Anonymous Communication]], subscribing to the [[Computer Security|security principals]]. 

### How?
- It works by taking a bunch of users' requests, mixing them and then sending out batches of requests to the servers.
- If you send a request, you need to include a *""return address""* encrypted with the mixer's public key. That way, you send a request, the mixer batches it, sends it to the server, the server responds to the mixer and mixer returns to you. 

### The Different Types:
- ***Time based***: The mixer can send out the batches after a $t$ seconds of traffic. That way, every message the mixer received in the last $t$ gets released.
	- **Problem:** [[Anonymity]] is entirely relying on a busy server. If only 1 person accessed the mixer, then it's obvious who's request that was
- ***Quota Based (Threshold):*** The mixer sends out batches after $n$ requests.
	- **Problem:** There's no guarantee how quickly you'll get it. 
- ***Quota and Time (Pool) Based:*** The mixer should have a minimum amount of messages ($n$) at all times. If that quota is matched, every $t$ seconds random fraction of $n$ gets released. 
	- **Problem:** You need lots of memory for the queue to be held.
- **Client Delay (Continuous) based:** Each client says ""delay my message this long"". The Mixer only has to obey it. Decide it randomly.

## How Could Sender Be [[Anonymity|Anonymous]] To The Server?
- Craft a request envelope. It has an encrypted *""original sender""*. 
	- The *""original sender""* field is encrypted with the *""Response Mixer""'s* public key. 
	- The entire envelope is encrypted with the *""Forward Sending Mixer""'s* public key.
- Send this to *""Forward Sending Mixer""*. 
	- FSM decrypts the first
- Mixer sends this to the server. 
- Server responds to a *""Response Mixer""*
- *Response Mixer* decrypts the *""Original Sender""*'s address. 
- Response Mixer then sends it back

![[Pasted image 20241215174059.png|500]]

#### Why Use 2 Mixers?
- ***Single Point of Failure:*** A single mix could tie the user to the server. If it got compromised, security over. 
- Prevents Time Correlation Attacks.


## Attacks on Mixed Communications:
- ***Time Correlation Attacks:*** 
	- Imagine you control the entry and exit node. 
	- You observe the traffic's timing and volume. 
	- You try and pair the entry's patterns to the exit's patterns. 
	- *Requires entry and exit node control. *
	- (Also applicable to [[Tor 🧅]]) 
	- It can be defended by ***padding messages*** and ***buffering***. 
- ***$N$-1 Attack:***
	- If a *mixer* has a capacity of $N$, then what's to stop the attacker sending $N-1$ messages with a known location?
	- When you send the final message, you're easily linked to the recipient

## *Defences Against* Attacks on Mixed Communications
- It can be defended by ***padding messages*** and ***buffering***. 
- ***Dummy messages:*** Prevents the $N-1$ attack. That way they can't be linked back to you."

Speed (Requests Vs. Throughput).md,"Speed (Requests Vs. Throughput).md

> [!warning] Important!
> This is not the same as [[Efficiency in Algorithms]]. This refers more to the speed of a [[Distributed System Architecture|distributed system]].
## What:
When talking about the speed of a system, we often want to maximise speed. But what does speed mean? There's 2 kinds we may want to maximise:
1. **Latency**
2. **Throughput**
#### 1. Latency
Latency is about how fast your system **responds to a *single* request**. It's measured in milliseconds. The lower, the snappier performance for the end-user.

#### 2. Throughput
Throughput is all about how many requests the system can handle simultaneously. Higher throughput means more users can be served at once. (Measured in *requests per second* - the higher the better)

### The Catch?
Optimising for 1 severely hurts the other. For example, [[Cache|caching]] frequently used information reduced latency, but means the available memory for other users is now reduced - thus reducing throughput. Or batching requests can handle throughput but reduce latency."
AWS EC2.md,"AWS EC2.md

### Amazon is responsible for:
- Making sure it doesn't fail duh

### The Different Kinds:
- **Dedicated Host**: Basically just a server for you. You're billed per amount of servers (hosts) you have. Expensive, but meets compliance. Fully dedicated hardware
- **Saving Plans:** Basically just make a contract with AWS to agree a per/hour workload on a 1-3 year commitment.

Merge Sort.md,"Merge Sort.md

### How does it work:
The fundamental principal is to split the original array into two, and [[Recursive Algorithm|recursively]] apply Merge Sort on them. You repeatedly divide the array into half until the base case (you have an array just 2 long). Compare the 2 items, and join them in the correct order. Now begin building back up. Now you have 2 sorted arrays each of 2 long.  Compare the first of both arrays, then insert where necessary. Repeat until you have a sorted array of 4 long. Repeat until you reach the top of the rabbit hole again. 

[[Time Complexity]]: Best case and worst case scenario are actually quite similar. It is $\Theta(nlg(n))$ ."
Radius of Convergence.md,"Radius of Convergence.md

### What?
With relation to all types of [[Power Series]], it's the interval around the $c$ centre of the power series that the series converges for every $x$ (i.e. accurately representing the function).

### How to get it:
Once you get $r$ using [[Converting Function to Power Series|this]], you can put $-1 \lt r \lt 1$ to solve for RoC."
IP Address.md,"IP Address.md

## What: IPv4
Network is divided into network, subnet and host.

Asymmetric Encryption.md,"Asymmetric Encryption.md

## What?
Think back to [[Symmetric Encryption]], where everyone necessary already has the key. How do you communicate securely with someone who doesn't **already have a key**? (Called Asymmetric because there's 2 keys involved). 

### Public Key Encryption:
You can openly share the ***Public Key*** with people, and it's good to *encrypt* everything. To *decrypt*, however, you need a ***Private Key***. 

## How it works:
1. Bob will first generate a ***Private Key*** and ***Public Key*** pair. (Analogous to a key and padlock respectively, everyone can lock but only the key-holder can unlock). Most keys use the [[RSA Algorithm]].
3. Alice will request the *public key* (padlock) from Bob. Bob will send it
4. Alice will encrypt her message using the public key and send it to Bob. 
5. Bob can decrypt *her* message using *his* private key. 
6. They will now repeat this process for Alice, so she can now decrypt Bob's encrypted messages. 

![[ScreenRecording2024-10-21at4.28.51p.m.-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif|500]]

### *Double Encryption* (Italicised cos it's cool.)
- If you encrypt something with Alice's public key, then only her private key can open it. 
- If something's encrypted with your private key (of which only you have), then only your public key can decrypt it. 
- Therefore, if you encrypt something with both your private key *and then* Alice's public key, then Alice can be sure that that only she would've been able to open that message and that it definitely came from you (in that order).
- If something you encrypt something with your public key, then only your private key can open it."
Homogeneous Equation.md,"Homogeneous Equation.md

# Homogeneous Equations

***Homogeneous Equations*** are SLE’s where the variables all come in the $a_1x_1, a_2x_2, … , a_nx_n = 0$ form (all the variables are $x_n$). 

For above, all $x$’s could equal 0. That is the ***trivial solution***. We’re looking for the ***non-trivial*** solution. 

<aside>
ℹ️ If a homogeneous equation has more variables than equations, it has infinitely many non-trivial solutions. (Thereom 1.3.1)

</aside>

***Linear Combinations:***

Simple Row operations on columns are simple:

![Screenshot 2022-09-26 at 10.42.13 a.m..png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/85678682-e925-4af2-8c61-ebf611729a55/Screenshot_2022-09-26_at_10.42.13_a.m..png)

The $2x + 5y$ is a ***linear combination*** of $x$ and $y$. Formally, when *multiples of* columns are summed together. Looks like: $sx+ty$

Know: 

Any linear combinations of solutions to a SLE is again a solution. Shown:

Taking $x= \begin{bmatrix} x_1\\ x_2\\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix}$and $y= \begin{bmatrix} y_1\\ y_2\\ \vdots \\ y_n \end{bmatrix}$*as solutions*, then $sx +ty= \begin{bmatrix} sx_1+ty_1\\ sx_2+ty_2\\ \vdots \\ sx_n+ty_n \end{bmatrix}$are also solutions.

The following thereom is really overly complicated for a really simple concept. 

ℹ️ Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix of rank $r$, and consider the homogeneous system with $n$ variables with A as the coeffecient matrix. Then:

1. The system has exactly $n - r$ basic solutions (1 solution for every parameter). 
2. Every solution is a linear combination of these basic solutions. 


What does that mean? Simply in non math-convoluted crap;

When you boil a homo matrix down, every variable has a solution. Any other solution you get is actually just a permutation of those basic solutions."
Random Variable (Probability).md,"Random Variable (Probability).md

Given a sample space S, it's a rule that associates a number with each outcome in $S$. 

> [!summary] GPT's Example
> Imagine you're at a carnival, and there's a game where you throw a ball at a set of cans. The number of cans you knock down will determine the prize you get.
> 
> *[[Sample Space]] (S)*: This is like the entire set of all possible outcomes from throwing the ball. In this case, it's every possible combination of cans that could be knocked down (including knocking none at all).
> 
> *Experiment*: The act of throwing the ball and seeing how many cans fall is the experiment.
> 
> *Random Variable (rv)*: This is like the person at the booth who watches your throw and then assigns points to you based on the number of cans you knock down. This ""rule"" of assigning points is the random variable.

X(s) = x means that x is the value associated with the outcome s by the $rv\ X$

Example2.2 Consider the experiment in which a telephone number in a certain area code is dialed using a random number dialer (such devices are used extensively by polling organisations), and define an $rv$ $Y$ by:

$$
Y = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if the selected number is unlisted} \\
0 & \text{if the selected number is listed in the directory}
\end{cases}
$$

For example, if 5282966 appears in the telephone directory, then Y(5282966) = 0, whereas Y(7727350) = 1 tells us that the number 7727350 is unlisted. A word description of this sort is more economical than a complete listing, so we will use such a description whenever possible. 

**Discrete RV**: is a countable, integer RV.
**Continuous RV**: The decimal possibilities of RVs. Interestingly, the $P(X=x) = 0$. Why? Well because there's an infinite amount of CRVs between $a$ and $b$, that the possibility of hitting a specific one is nothing. 

> [!summary] Proposition:
> For any two numbers $a$ and $b$ with $a \leq b$,

> [!warning] Note:
> This page refers specifically to the MIPS-flavoured Assembly Language. Click here to read more about the [[MIPS (Architecture)]]. Alternatively you can also read about [[OS Memory Management (x86)|x86 assembly]].
### What?
It's an (extremely low-level) programming language that corresponds closely to the commands of an [[ISA (Architecture)]]. As such programming language, it's human readable. The mapping from [[MIPS (Architecture)]] and MIPS Assembly Language is 1-1. What does that mean? At the end of the day, the (ISA) instructions you feed into a computer are just 1s and 0s. Assembly is a symbolic representation of MIPS which is a representation of machine instructions. 

### The Assembler:
The rest of this page is the syntax and how to code the coding language. But how do we actually ***convert*** the ***""human readable""*** (it's still fucking hard to understand) coding language *into machine code* - 1's and 0's? That's the assembler. 

### Instruction Breakdown:
- ***R-Type:*** `operator $destination, $source1, $source2`
	- EG: `add $t0, $t1, $t2   # $t0 = $t1 + $t2`
- ***I-Type:*** `operator $destination, $source, immediate`
	- EG: `addi $t0, $t1, 5    # $t0 = $t1 + 5`
- ***Memory Access:*** `operator $destination/source, offset($base)`
	- EG: ` lw $t0, 4($t1)      # Load word from address ($t1+4) into $t0`
	- EG: ` sw $t0, 8($t1)      # Store word from $t0 to address ($t1+8)`

### Note on `BEQ $address` works:
> [!danger] Note on how `BEQ` registers work
> When BEQ has a label, it's actually how many instructions away from the current instruction it is (i.e. 3 instructions down). To get the byte address, we [[Shifting|left shift]] it by 2 (i.e. multiply it by 4 to get its byte address from the current spot). 

### Note on how `j-type` instructions work:
Unlike BEQ, `j-type` contain the absolute address 

### [[Registers]] Conventions
- Program variables are held in \$s0-$s7
- Temporary variable es inside a method call: \$t0-$t9
- Registers \$a0-$a3 are used for passing arguments into functions.
- Register $zero is legit hardwired to 0
- There's a Program Counter (PC). This literally just keeps track of the instruction to execute for the [[CPU - Processor Components|CPU]]
- There's other special ones lol. 
- Also check [this](https://chat.openai.com/share/2090904c-2f27-4215-83fe-efc9d1b6be9f) conversation for a better idea. 
 
![[Screenshot 2023-09-28 at 3.42.01 p.m..png|400]]


### Operating on stuff > 32 bits? 
If you have a list and are reading in billions of entries, you can't store those in [[Registers]]. Instead, you store them in [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually|memory]]. The way to transfer the two? Data Transfer Instructions. You can store an array's memory's address into the register. 

### Set if Less Than (SLT), Branch if EQual (BEQ):
You can use the following keywords to perform basic comparisons:
- SLE - Set if Less or Equal to
- SGT - Set if Greater Than
- SGE - Set if Greater than or Equal to
- SEQ - Set if EQual to
- SNE - Set if Not Equal to
![[Screenshot 2023-10-15 at 12.54.05 p.m..png|400]]

### Assembly Example:
```Assembly
slt $t0, $s0, $s1 # Sets t0 to 1 if true, else to 0 if not.
beq $t0, $zero, l1 # If above was set to 0, jump to L1
and $s3, $s2, $s1 # Perform bitwise AND 
j l2 
l1: or $s3, $s2, $s1 # Perform bitwise OR
l2:
```

### Method Calls:
In [[Python]] or [[Java]], there's the ability to declare a function somewhere and call it somewhere else. [[MIPS (Architecture)]] does this in a roundabout way. 

We use `jal label` to Jump-And-Link to a specific label. The use of the *And-Link* bit? It sets \$ra to where you were before you left jumped. Then, whenever you want to return to wherever you were before the method call, simply run `jr ra`.

##### Convention for 'Method Calls':
The following isn't true in MIPS by default. We have to write the code so that it is. 
- Typically store *'parameters'* to \$a0 - $a3
- Typically store *'return values'* to $v0 and $v1
- Registers $s0 - $s7 *are stored* across call boundaries.
- Registers $t0 - $t9 *aren't stored* across call boundaries.

## What?
It's a program that ***translates*** an executable program in one [[C (Programming Language)|language]] into an executable program in another. Ideally, it improves the program (in some way) in the process. It's different from an [[Interpreter]].

### What's the Point?
It allows us to code in one language and execute it in another.
#### What other functions does it have?
- Must recognise legal (and illegal) programs, and spit them out as errors if so. 
- Must generate correct machine code. 
- Must store machine code and variables.


### Traditional 2-Step Compiler:
![[Screenshot 2025-01-19 at 6.37.02 p.m..png]]
- The [[Compiler Frontend|Frontend]] transforms the code into an *Internal Representation* (IR).
	- It also checks for correctness.
- The backend takes that representation, optimises and then converts it to machine code. 

#### Examples:
- [[C (Programming Language)|C]] is typically compiled into [[(MIPS) Assembly Language|Assembly]]. (This would be going from a [[Computer Science|programming language]] to the [[ISA (Architecture)]])."

Like in the blue image above, they're easily represented as an array. The neat thing? If you have the index $i$ of a value in the array, you can get its children or parent indices by the below:

- *Right Child* is at: $2\cdot i+2$
- *Parent* is at: $(i-1)//2$ (floor division)
- *Leaves* are: $A[\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor + 1: n]$


### Properties of them (Max specifically):
- ***Parent $\ge$ either of its children nodes***.
- ***The largest element is always at the root***.
- ***Complete binary Tree***: Every layer (except possible the last) is completely filled with children. 
- ***Height of a node***: The number of edges on the from there to the leaf. EG $h(T)=h(0)$ (the root of tree on left) is 2. 

### What's the point?

Dynamic Programming.md,"Dynamic Programming.md

### What?
Similar to [[Greedy Algorithms]], it's a methodology for solving *optimisation problems*. It involves:
- **Breaking the problem into subproblems** that (ideally) repeat several times in the larger problem.
	- Each problem is ordered from smallest to largest.
- Designing the optimal solution so that it's (ideally) **repeatedly constructed from the optimal solutions of the subproblems**.
	- The optimal solution of the subproblems can be constructed from the optimal solutions of the sub-sub-problems. (***Optimal Substructure***)
- **Storing the Subproblem solutions**: ([[Memoization]])"
Format Strings Exploit.md,"Format Strings Exploit.md

## Background?
Again, a different flavour of [[Buffer Overflow Attack|buffer overflows]]. String formatting functions can take a variable amount of parameters. EG: `printf(""Hey {0} {1}! Today is {2}..."", arg_0, arg_1, ..., arg_n)`. The [[The Stack's Use in MIPS|stack's]] representation of that looks like this:

![[Pasted image 20241111123318.png|150]]

## Ok... So how?
If an attacker is able to pass the actual string to be formatted, then the string format function is vulnerable. Using the code below, an adversary could print the next 4 values of the stack and then print the print the stack value as a pointer.

```cpp
printf(""%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x|%s"");

A fundamental concept in [[Calculus]]. 

When dealing with exponents, smart people defined the number $e$.

> The slope of the function $e^t$ at any point $t$ is $e$. 

Consider the function $a^t$. An alternative (and often preferable) way of writing that is $e^{ct}$, where $c$ is $ln(a)$. 

### Formula for Exponents:

> - $P_0$ is the *initial starting value*,

> [!Brief] Brief
> FS-AI teams must assume that they have been approached to tender for an AI system which is to go into production within 24 months. The AI system is for a new Autonomous Driving System Vehicle which operates at SAE level 4 in a city centre environment moving people from the outskirts of the city centre into the heart of the city centre on defined route

We originally came up with Movar, described below:
> [!green] Movar Description
 A business plan presentation for [[Statics]] where you have to come up with a suitable business plan and pitch it to potential investors. 
 The business plan has to be centered around an *autonomous system* that transports  people from the outskirts of [[Edinburgh]] to the city center. 

### Where it started:
It started as a ""time-share"" for your car. You got to own a luxury vehicle for certain times of the day. You would select when you want the car at your disposal and at those times the car would just... show up. Then you'd hop in and automatically your [[Spotify]] would start playing, your climate preference would apply and calendar would be brought up. 

From there, you'd choose on the app where (of your favourite locations) you'd like to go. And voilá! Your car would automatically drive yourself to that location. 

### Changes Needed:
Unfortunately, we found it quite hard to find a decent target market for this. As a result, we changed it to be for... **Buses**!! 

### Bovar Script (Software bit):
#### Inputs Slide:
- So here's a simplified version of how our software operates
- We take a range of data from our various sensors around the bus, as well as the predfined route chosen by operators.

#### Perception Slide:
- We feed these inputs into a neural net architecture that provides the backbone for a variety of other actions related to perception and understanding what's around the car. 
- Many of these functions are heavily interconnected and recurrent. On the vision side,  our segmentation, object detection and sensor fusion algorithms are heavily interdependent, allowing us quick visualisation of what's actually going on around the car.
- On the localisation side, we use [[SLAM]] to constantly have updated maps of the world around us, as well as to better orientate the car within it's surroundings.

#### Planning & Control Slide:
- This section of our stack is responsible for creating and evaluating the best path forward for making progress on the road. 
- We do this with a variety of functions. Based on hard coded rules we have, like follow the speed limits, direct obstacles etc, we plan routes progressing the road. We evaluate these routes and assess these risks on a variety of factors. 
- Once we have the route planned, we evaluate the path, factoring risk, inherant uncertainty, and  latency. 
- We then determine determine the controls for the actuator which...

#### Actuator Slide:
- ... Then gets fed into the actually controlling the actuators. 



### Hardware Brainstorming Specifically for BPP:
[[Sensors for AV's]]
- [[Lidar]]?
	- What do we need?
	- 5 Lidar per bus
	- We're long distance, transport poverty areas focused, primarily focused on west lothian and fife direction. 
	- 5 routes per area (2 areas -> West lothian and Fife council), 5 buses per route. 
- [[Radar]]?
	- 8 radar. 1 each corner 1 each middle? Why because we said so. Imogen was right :( ... Maybe next time check your notes leo you muppet. 
	- Delphi ESR
- [[Ultrasonic Sensors]]:
	- Not needed - Exec decision by Imogen!
- [[Cameras]]:
	- Triton 5.4 MP. They've already been used on buses. 

### [[Software for AVs|Software:]]




## Cruise Feedback:
The entire feedback can be found [[Cruise Feedback|here]]. It boils down the below. 
### Things to refine / improve:
- Costings. You must consider all other types of costs. These include:
	- NRE, maintenence, testing, cleaning, customer support, telemtry etc.
	- Mounting is too low. More like 5-10K. 
	- 20k for computer is too much. More like 10k.
- Hammer home the idea we're solving transport poverty. Better justifcation for using buses. 
	- Ask ourselves, what problem are we solving by choosing buses? Are we actually improving sustainability?
- Have a 2-3 year plan with ***justifcation*** - in fact, have justification for everything. Remember to utilise handout. 

### Things to add:
- How many people people we plan to serve within a time frame
- Using that and the cost of operating, calculate expected revenue + business model.
- Growth over time
	- How can we reduce sensors over time
	- Fleet growth over time
- (According to Cruise) Be upfront with investors about challenges. 
- Justification for having an electric bus / change to a hydrogen bus. 
- Local council / governance. 
- Include a map on transport links page. 
- Define the exact size of the bus

### Things to remove:
- Do not 3D print stuff
- Reduce the amount on Software :(
- Condense Sensors to a single slide

### Outstanding Questions for Cruise:
- Is our current sensor setup unreasonable? (Show include slides / screenshots / descriptions)
	- Do we have too many Lidars / Radar?
- What role does a production / assembly line look like for AV's
	- This is something I'd like to have a sitdown with Grace over the clarification of the rules
- (Imo's) Once we flesh out the finances, can we get a sanity check on the numbers?

Lists.md,"Lists.md

### What? Duh. 
A type of [[Data Structures]] where you have a collection of items. Depending on the programming language, be it [[Python]] or [[Java]], you could have different implementations of these in memory.

### Typical Desirables in All Implementations:
Depending on the type of implementation you choose, they will always take different [[Time Complexity]]. 
- .get
- .append
- .insert

### Fixed Length Arrays:
So, [[Fixed Length Arrays]] are typically of fixed length $m$. The time complexities can be as follows:
- `.get(i)` -> $\Theta(1)$
	- Also true for `.set() .append() .length()`
- `.insert(i)` -> $\Theta(n)$. 
	- Why? Because the arrays are fixed length, you have to copy a brand new one with the updated integer. 
	- Also true for `.cons() .delete()`
##### Advantages of FLA:
- Rapid `.get()` and `.set()` -> Especially if this is on the [[Stack vs Heap|Stack]].  
- Fixed, predictable size
##### Disadvantages:
- Doesn't cope well for `len(list)` > $m$. 
- Also, if $n$ is variable, then it will over- or under-cater ([[Data Overflow]]). 

### Extensible Arrays:
It's similar to a Fixed Length Array but different in a key way. If array $A$ overflows, you replace it with a bigger one! If, in [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually]], there's space directly after where $A$ was, you can just continue on. This is free and cheap. 

But what if there's no space after $A$? You have to make a fresh array B and then perform what you wanted to on it. 
##### Time Complexity of Extensible Arrays:
Ok. So most times you can just continue on in memory ($\Theta(1)$). But what about the times you have to copy a brand new array into somewhere new in memory? $\Theta(n)$. This seems like a dirty implementation, but the cost of a bad time complexity is spread out (read [[Amortised Cost|amortised]]) over all the good ones.

These are:
- Universal Quantifier -> ""For all"" -> $\forall$

- ""Many""
- ""None""

DNS Cache Poisoning.md,"DNS Cache Poisoning.md

## What?
Ideally, you give a DNS server [[Name Server]] a false address record and get it cached. Then, when a user makes a request to that DNS server, the cache is your fake record! Boom, the user, unbeknownst to them, is now a victim.

### How did the Attacker do it?
1. At some point, some name server asks for the IP address of some domain.
	1. E.g. ISP sends out `request 123` asking for `google.com`.
2. We (malicious actors) send a bunch of request responses to ISP, trying to brute force the potential `request ID`'s.
	1. E.g. We (malicious) send 100 requests, from `request 80` -> `request 150`, all saying that `google.com` is at our `Evil IP`. 
3. If any of those hit, then we got our `Evil IP` cached on the ISP's name server.

### More about the query:
- The `Query ID` is often a randomised, 16-bit identifier and return port. 
- So if we spammed it, then you may have a decent chance at guessing it.

### Taking it 1 step further:
- What if the someone requests `123random.google.com`? Since it's not in the cache, it does DNS to find the authoritative name server. 
- What if you set up a name server that knows `123random.google.com`? This leads them to a compromised server. 

### Defences against it:
- ***Port Randomisation AND Request Randomisation:*** The identifier can be spammed, but what if we randomise the source port? Then the chances of guessing that also drops.
- ***Limit Cache Lifetime (TTL - Time To Live):*** Minimises impact of poisoned cache by expiring records quickly. 
- ***Rate Limiting:*** Limits the number of [[Domain Name System (DNS)|DNS]] responses processed per second from the same source.

### 1. **Big O Notation (Upper Bound)**:
- **Notation:** $O(f(n))$
- **Definition:** $f(n)=O(g(n))$ if there exist positive constants $c$ and $n_0$​ such that $0≤f(n)≤c⋅g(n)$ for all $n>n_0$​.
- **Textbook Defintion**: $∃C>0,∃N,∀n≥N:f(n)≤Cg(n)$
- **Intuition:** Big O notation gives an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm, describing the worst-case scenario.
- **Simply:** $f(n)$ grows no faster than $g(n)$
- **Example:** $f(n)=2n^2+3n+1=O(n^2)$

### 2. **Big Omega Notation (Lower Bound)**:
- **Notation:** $Ω(f(n))$
- **Definition:** $f(n)=Ω(g(n))$ if there exist positive constants $c$ and $n_0$​ such that $0≤c⋅g(n)≤f(n)$ for all $n>n_0$. 
- **Textbook Definition**: $∃C>0,∃N,∀n≥N:f(n)≥Cg(n)$
- **Intuition:** Big Omega notation gives a lower bound on the growth rate of an algorithm, describing the best-case scenario.
- **Simply**: $f(n)$ grows no slower than $g(n)$
- **Example**:$f(n)=2n^2+3n+1=\Omega(n^2)$

### 3. **Big Theta Notation (Tight Bound)**:
- **Notation:** $Θ(f(n))$
- **Definition:** $f(n)=Θ(g(n))$ if and only if $f(n)=O(g(n))$ and $f(n)=Ω(g(n))$.
- **Textbook Definition**: $∃C_1​>0,∃C_2​>0,∃N,∀n≥N:C_1g(n)≤f(n)≤C_2​g(n)$
- **Intuition:** Big Theta notation gives both an upper and lower bound on the growth rate of an algorithm, describing the average-case scenario.
- **Example**: $f(n)=2n^2+3n+1=\Theta(n^2)$
- **Fun Fact**: It's commutable

### 4. **Little o Notation (Upper Bound, but not Tight)**:
- **Notation:** $o(f(n))$
- **Definition:** $f(n)=o(g(n))$ if for every constant $c>0$, there exists a constant $n_0$​ such that $0≤f(n)<c⋅g(n)$ for all $n>n_0$.
- **Textbook Definition**: $∀C>0,∃N,∀n≥N:f(n)<Cg(n)$
- **Intuition:** Little o notation gives an upper bound like Big O, but it is not tight. It indicates that $f(n)$ grows strictly slower than $g(n)$.
- **Example**: $f(n)=n=o(n^2)$ (I.E. $n^2$ grows faster than $n$)

### 5. **Little omega Notation (Lower Bound, but not Tight)**:
- **Notation:** $ω(f(n))$
- **Definition:** $f(n)=ω(g(n))$ if for every constant $c>0$, there exists a constant $n_0$​ such that $0≤c⋅g(n)<f(n)$ for all $n>n_0$.
- **Textbook Definition**: $∀C>0,∃N,∀n≥N:f(n)>Cg(n)$
- **Intuition:** Little omega notation gives a lower bound like Big Omega, but it is not tight. It indicates that $f(n)$ grows strictly faster than $g(n)$.
- **Example**: $f(n)=n^2=\omega(n)$ (I.E. $n^2$ grows slower than $n$)


> [!check] Difference between Big and little?
> The Big $O$, $\Omega$, $\Theta$ all give you exact time limit of a function. They're *hard* bounded (E.G. $<=n$). They're the ""at most / at least"". 
> 
> **Whereas** the Little $o$, $\omega$ are the equivalent of saying ""Strictly Less/Greater Than"". (E.G. $<n$)


> [!danger] Weird Quirk:
> Say an algorithm's Big O is $n$ (the amount of time it will take is $<= n$). It would also be true to say that it has a time complexity of $n^2$ and $n^3$. It's less informative and we tend to only be interested in the most *tightest* bound for an algorithm we can get. 
### Properties:
##### Transitivity:
If upper bound of f(n) is g(n) and upper bound of g(n) is h(n), then upper limit of f(n) is h(n). It's the same (but opposite) for lower bound. 

##### Summation of Bounds:
If you sum 2 functions with the same bound, you get back the same bound.

Encryption.md,"Encryption.md

## Speed. I am Speed.
We care about efficiency. One of the ways we do this is by using [[Asymmetric Encryption]] to securely send over the [[Symmetric Encryption|symmetric keys]]. (The latter is quicker.)

## What makes a secure encryption?
- Ideally an enemy can't make their own secret *key*.
- Ideally an enemy can't recover the entire plaintext *m*.
- Ideally an enemy can't recover *any* of the plaintext *m*.

## The attacker may have access to:
- Some plaintext
- Some cipher text / plain text pairs
- They may have access to the encryptor (*encryption oracle*) that can encrypt plain text. 
- They likely would only have a realistic amount of compute.

## WTF do we do with Keys?
Good question lol. 

### What's Malleability in Encryption:
If an attacker can change the ciphertext in such a way that it ***predictably*** changes the then decrypted plaintext, the encryption is malleable.

#### NAT:
Your device is within a network, managed by a router. That router has a dedicated IP (that's visible to the outside world). When your device makes a request for that external server, your router swaps out your IP for it. So that when the external server responds, it responds with the message for your router.

> ***The key idea behind the algorithm is that, while the Private Key and Public Key are different, they're mathematically related. It's impossible to guess how to go from one to the other.*** 

## What:
So, the crux of [[Asymmetric Encryption]] is that you can come up with a Private-Public Key pair that's pretty damn secure. How do you do that though? Using this Algorithm. 

### Encrypting the Message:
We'll use the following [[Encryption]] formula
$$c = m^e \mod n$$

Where:
- $c$ is the **ciphertext** (the encrypted message).
- $m$ is the **message** that is being encrypted.
- $e$ is the **public exponent** (public key entry 1).
- $n$ is the **modulus** (public key entry 2).

***Basically:*** 
- Given a *public key* like `(5,14)`, you take your message, put `key[0]` as an exponent, and get the modulus of `key[1]` as your ciphertext. 

Example:
1. For this example, my public key is `(5,14)`. My private key is `(11,14)`
2. If I want to send the secret message `B`, I represent it as ASCII with `2`. 
3. My cipher text is: $2^{5}\mod 14 = 4$  
4. Therefore, my secret message `B` is encrypted as `D`

### Decrypting the Message
It's literally the same, but using the private key. 

### How'd you come up with those keys?? 
1. Pick 2 (HUGE) prime numbers.
	- $p = 2$
	- $q = 7$
2. Get the product of those numbers.
	- $n = 14$
3.  Get the *amount* of ***co-prime*** numbers with 14. 
	- *Co-prime: A number that does not share any factors with another.* 1
	- This number can be got with the formula: $(p-1)(q-1)$
	- $\phi(n) = 6$
4. Come up with a number $e$ that follows the following criteria:
	- $1 < e < \phi(n)$
	- $e$ is co-prime with both $n$ and $\phi(n)$. 
	- Note how $5$ is both of those. 
5. Finally, we want to come up with a number $d$ - your letter for decrypting.
	- Choose $d$ such that: $de(\mod \phi(n))=1$ 
	- There'll be infinite amount of options to choose from. There's some (more complicated) rules to this."

Limits.md,"Limits.md

### Perspective Realisation:
So far, we've been interpreting limits without even realising it. The term $\frac{d}{dx}$ actually has the idea of a limit built in. As you make a tiny change thats so tiny (so tiny it may even be approaching 0 😉), you can get the derivative / slope of a function. 

> [!info] Formal Definition
> $$\frac{d}{dx}f(2) = lim_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}$$
> This is nice because it avoids the paradox of ""infinitely small"". 

There's also an Epsilon Delta definition 😞.

> [!note] ED Definition
> Imagine an input range and output range. If you shrink the input range enough, then the corresponding output range should also still be able to shrink. Thus there's a defined limit.

There's also the idea of [[L'Hopital's Rule]].


### Limit Laws:
![[Screenshot 2023-07-30 at 9.37.01 a.m..png]]"
Diffie-Hellman.md,"Diffie-Hellman.md

## What?
It's the mechanism for how we create a [[Asymmetric Encryption|private key]] over an unsecure channel. It's not so much exchanging keys, but actually creating them together. We'll see that below:

### Setup:
-  Imagine you've got Alice's private key, Bob's private key and a pre-established key. They also both openly agree on a HUGE number $n$. There's also a much smaller number, $g$. This tends to be a smaller, prime number that is used so commonly the same that many computers just use a pre-existing number as a standard.

1. Alice randomly chooses a private key, $a$, between $1$ and $n-1$. Bob also does the same for private key $b$.
2. Alice makes $A = g^{a}\mod n$. She shares $A$ publicly. 
3. Bob makes $B=g^b \mod n$. He shares $B$ publicly.
4. Alice will then compute her final secret: $s_{alice} = B^a \mod n = (g^{b} \mod n)^a \mod n = (g^b)^a \mod n = g^{ba} \mod n$
5. The beauty of this is that whenever Bob calculates his final secret, it will ALSO EQUAL $s=g^{ab} \mod n$. And neither of them shared either $a$ nor $b$ to the public! Genius imo.
6. ***Alice's Public Key:*** is $(n,g,A)$, where $A=g^{a} \mod p$
7. Don't ask how (right now), but we can use that to come up with a cipher-text that is only undone if someone has $a$. 

### (Open) Problems:
- This works flawlessly!.. If you're assuming the attacker in the open is passive. But what if the attacker changes the values that get shared to the public? Like the attacker would be able to tell Alice it's Bob and Bob it's Alice. The solution? Sign every message using [[Digital Signature]] ***(Station to Station)***. 
- You can achieve [[Forward Secrecy]] by using temporary (ephemeral) private keys for each session. 

### Station to Station:
- When sharing $A$ or $B$ publicly, sign them with your private key (requires effective [[Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)|PKI]]). That way, anyone who tries to be in the middle, isn't able to change their ***A*** to ***E***! *(Remember, thanks to [[Asymmetric Encryption]], we can sign things with our private key, and our public key let's people know it's exclusively ours!)*

## ElGamal Encryption, by Comparison:
Surprisingly simple. 
- In Diffie-Hellman, two parties come up with a key together (using the algorithm above.)
- In El Gamal, we come up with 2 keys and use them for the encryption. It comes up with 
	- Instead of simply saying *""Ok cool we've both agreed on keys to use""* as DH does, ElGamal just starts using the keys to encrypt and decrypt messages. 

Thus, DH is a sub-set of ElGamal."
Firewall.md,"Firewall.md

## What?:
A device that isolates the ""*secure*"" private network to the ""*unsecure*"" public network.

### How?
Basically it applies *policies* (read: rules) that decides whether to allow or deny traffic. May look something like below. Note that the rules go top to bottom. :

![[Pasted image 20241002114639.png|500]]

## Types of Firewalls:
#### Packet Filters (stateless):
- If a packet matches the packet filter's set of rules, the filter will drop it.

#### Stateful:
- Maintains a record of all connections passing through it and can determine if a packet is either the start of a new connection, an existing connection or an invalid packet.

#### Application Layer:
- Works like a ***proxy*** - can *""read""* through protocols. Would inspect traffic, blocking based on it's rules (eg blocking websites, viruses etc.).

#### Takeaway of them?
They're good. You need one. But they won't do much."
Symmetric Encryption.md,"Symmetric Encryption.md

## What?
Encryption where everyone that wants to read the message, has the same key. 

### What makes a secure encryption?
- Ideally an enemy can't make their own secret *key*.
- Ideally an enemy can't recover the entire plaintext *m*.
- Ideally an enemy can't recover *any* of the plaintext *m*.

### The attacker may have access to:
- Some plaintext
- Some cipher text / plain text pairs
- They may have access to the encryptor (*encryption oracle*) that can encrypt plain text. 
- They likely would only have a realistic amount of compute.


## WTF do we do with Keys?
Good question lol. 

### What's Malleability in Encryption:
If an attacker can change the ciphertext in such a way that it ***predictably*** changes the then decrypted plaintext, the encryption is malleable."

> [!warning] Architecture$^2$
> Wait! This page refers to ***OS architecture***, which focuses on designing an environment for applications to run, abstracted away from hardware details. It's different from [[ISA (Architecture)]], which defines how software at the lowest level (eg [[(MIPS) Assembly Language|assembly]]) operates. 

## What Can It Do?
There's some key identifiers:
- It's in charge of separating the [[Kernel Vs User Mode]]. s.
- It runs [[Processes]]

## Parts to it...
It's the interface between a computer's hardware and the software running and users. It handles:
- [[CPU - Processor Components]]
- [[Virtual Memory]]
- [[IO]] and more...



### Potential [[Computer Security]] Concerns:
- The computer may have users with different permissions to the resources of the computer. The OS should have mechanisms to ***isolate different users***. ([[Privilege Separation]])
	- One user should be able to run `sudo`, another should not - quite a unique problem when you think about it. 
- The OS should have a way to run different applications at the same time, ***safely***. The terminal (or malicious app) shouldn't be able to access the memory of your web-browser."

Probability Distributions - PMF vs PDF vs CDF vs More.md,"Probability Distributions - PMF vs PDF vs CDF vs More.md

There's ~~2~~ many types of [[Probability]] distributions, including the PMF and PDF:

![[FuUZFZoaMAANGH3.jpeg|500]]

### Notation:
`X ~ Unif[a,b]` -> This is saying X is spread across a probability distribution according to the distribution *Unif*orm.

### PDF - Probability Density Function:
A probability distribution for continuous random variables.
### PMF - Probability Mass Function:
A probability distribution for discrete random variables. 
### CDF - Cumulative Distribution Function:
At a point x, it gives the probability that the variable will take a value less than or equal to x. It's non decreasing and can be thought of adding up all the probabilities until that point. 

![[800px-Exponential_distribution_cdf.svg.png|300]]

##### Calculating probability a variable falls between $x_1$ and $x_2$?
Simply do $P(x_2)-P(x_1)$.

##### Converting PDF to CDF
Integrate the PDF from $-\infty$ to the desired $x_1$. To go the other way, it's the same process but deriving with respect to that variable. 


### Different Types:

- [[Uniform Distribution]]
- [[Standard Normal Deviation]]"

## Context:
How does the [[Operating System (OS)]] identify its users:
- ***Username*** and ***password***.
- Part of [[Computer Security]]


### Password Attacks:
- ***Man In The Middle:*** Eve sits in the middle of me and the server as I try and authenticate. 
	- ***Defence:*** [[Encryption]] using [[SSL - TLS|TLS]]
- ***Social Engineering:*** Clicking on a link and submitting your credentials into somewhere where they're not meant to go.
	- ***Defences:*** 
		1. Make it difficult for phish to reach users.
		2. Make it easy to detect and report phish.
		3. Protect against phish if they did go through.
		4. Respond quickly to threats.
	- Also just user a password manager.
- ***Malware:*** I shouldn't need to explain what it is. But if you've got it, then they might have key-logger software.
	- ***Defence:*** 2FA. 
- ***Brute Force Guessing Attack:*** Guess everything. 
	- ***Defence:*** Rate limit them loser.
- ***Dictionary Attack:*** Take common words / passwords and brute force over millions of passwords 
	- ***Defence:*** Also rate limit, but also choose pass-phrases. Include Capatchas (where possible) to prevent bots from guessing.
- ***Offline guessing attacks:*** If worst comes to worst and your [[Databases]] of passwords got leaked, what're you gonna do? Imagine you stored them all in plaintext. Then every user you had is now compromised. 
	- ***Don't Encrypt Passwords:*** If hacker could steal passwords, they can likely steal the key as well. Anyone with the key can view passwords.
	- ***Don't Just Hash Passwords:*** If multiple people share passwords - it'll be pretty easy to guess what everyone is with a frequency analysis. 
	- ***Salt and [[Hash Table|Hash]] Passwords!:*** Get a password, add a random string to it and [[Cryptographic Hash Functions|hash]] it. Every user has a unique salt. 
		- Additionally, use a slow hash function!

Just use ***MFA and Password Manager!!!***"
DFS Vs BFS.md,"DFS Vs BFS.md

### Depth First Search:
- Given a node on a [[Graphs]], explore to the next non-visited node. Label the edge you just took as discovery edge. 
- Keep doing this until you're faced with purely explored paths.For each edge you that's explored, label it a *back edge*
- Backtrack to the most recent step in the path that had a unexplored paths. 
- Repeat.  
- Eventually, you'll backtrack to A. Thus, you're finished.
##### Notes:
- Enabling the labelling stops you from running infinitely.  
- ***Time Complexity***: $O(n+m)$ 


### Breadth First Search:
It selects an arbitrary root node neighbouring nodes first, before moving down to the next level of neighbours. It's like *""sweeping""* through a maze

## Personalised Radio Station *(BBC Radio4(U))*
#### TLDR:
A radio station (with visualisation!) that takes your news feed, has *two* hosts dynamically talk about it. They then introduce the next song and it plays on my Spotify. Once finished, they jump in and discuss the artist / song + mention fun facts. *(Idea -> execution in ~1 day)*. *Code available [here](https://github.com/theCampel/BBC-Radio-4U).*

          allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" 
          allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>


### Background:
In 2023, I wrote an [[Essays|essay]] imagining what the future would look like. A key part of it was the world would be personalised to every individual - this includes the radio we listen to. Naturally, I decided to take a Sunday off and build it. Find it [here](https://github.com/theCampel/BBC-Radio-4U/tree/main).

### Biggest Problems - Natural Timing
It took too long for the conversation to start. As well, there was ~3 seconds of silence after each conversational turn. Made listening experience unusable.
- ***2 Part Solution:*** 
	- ***A)*** Streamed audio instead of loaded and downloaded. (pretty obvious lol). Made the initial starting delay much more tolerable.
	- ***B) Multi-Threaded conversation generation:*** 
		- There were 2 threads: An *audio player* and a audio *generator thread*. 
		- The audio generator thread would create and stream audio into a queue (in order of conversational turns)
		- The moment the first item in the queue was *not empty*, the player would begin to play it. 
			- *Note: The first dialogue didn't need to be* fully *generated, just the first couple of bytes, as the generator would continue to stream into it as it played.*
		- The moment the player was done with a turn, it would immediately start playing the next item (conversational turn) in the queue. 
		- So long as the generator would generate audio faster than audio played, a seem-less conversation transpired.

- ***Problem 2; Visualisation:*** So I originally finished it and recorded it for my site, and realised it was so pointless without something to at least look at. The visualisation that followed drove me to insanity. I basically actually [[Learning|learned]] about [[Sound|sounds]] (learned about a lot in of different things) and got a better understanding for physical waves. 

Problem 2 was time the constraint. I challenged myself to do this in a single day. It was fun and really rewarding.

### Extensions:
- *Remove Junk Articles:* Too many articles from *The Verge*, *Wired* etc. were advertising related *(Eg best deals to get on Black Friday)*. Ideally, [[Large Language Models (LLMs)|BERT]] could be used to detect salesy-like titles and filter them out. 
	- *Note: According to someone at JPMorgan, BERT would perform better than traditional [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] by ~10%.*
- Reduce the waiting period between article selection and conversation begins. There's a couple of (unoptimised) processes between these, so shouldn't be too difficult. 
	- Slight problem is I want to add more complexity there. There's a tradeoff with `more stuff x speed`. *(EG: even a small BERT would cause delays).* Maybe preload the initial bit of conversation, eg introduction etc?)
- Currently, song selection is random (from my top 10 songs). Ideally, the user has some sort of preference over this. 

> [!todo] TODO
> Follow through with Bert extension - would give more experience with local models + fine tuning. Also refactor your visualisation code cos it could do with it.

## [[EdinburghAI]]
### What:
Not quite a coding project, but definitely one of the harder (and most rewarding) things I've done at [[University of Edinburgh|Uni]]. We made a space where people could meet others also interested in Machine Learning, as well as gave them excuses to build cool shit that utilised [[AI]]. More info on the [[EdinburghAI|page]].

### Biggest Learnings:
- ***Time Commitment:*** Running a society (well) is incredibly time-intensive. It's hard to do that, do well in your degree and save time for [[Work-Life Balance|your friends]] (and yourself of course). 
	- ***Solutions:*** I was forced to [[Learning|learn]] how to be more [[Productivity|efficient with my time]]. 
- ***Leading:*** I learned I love being surrounded by cracked people, all hyper-focused on a specific (albeit lofty) goal. I walk away from committee meetings hyper-energised. Specific learnings below, abbreviated version of [[Lessons From EdiAI|here]]
	- ***Lofty work and autonomy motivates people:*** Remind people that they're a part of something great *(in our case, the AI society of one of the best schools in the world)* and that they can do anything *(Eg: nothing stopping us from getting DeepMind in to give a talk*).  
	- ***Work visibly hard:*** This is obvious. The rest of the team should be equally invested, but if someone can't do something (non-technical obviously), the onus should fall on the leader to pick up the slack. They should know they're supported and not alone. *That said*, they should be invested to work through it even when it is hard.
	- ***Give people autonomy:*** Give genuinely important (and difficult) tasks to competent people. Give them resources and motivation (through lofty goals). Don't just pawn off stuff you don't want to do. Check in frequently, but leave it as theirs. Give them credit every step of the way. 
	- ***Quality of committee > Quantity of committee***. A small team of highly capable and motivated individuals will do ***far*** more work than a large team of half-assed half-interested people.

## Project's To Make:

#### AutoNote Maker:
***Background:***
- There's lots of stuff I already know and so rarely find a need to make a note for it. Making a note is not intuitive. It includes:
	- Being able to break the concept down into [[First Principals]].
	- Knowing all of the pages you currently have and linking to them when necessary. 
	- Following a similar style to all of your previous notes. 

***How I'd Imagine Doing It:***
- It would prob first get all of my notes and vectorise them. I now have a searchable [[Vector Embeddings|vector DB]]. 
- I create an outline (~3 sentences) of what the topic is all about. 
- I vectorise it and search through my DB and pick the most relevant / nearby notes and extract their text.
- I take all of that, plug it into a heavily prompt engineered LLMs. 
- And... Vóila?
- Ideally it was local for privacy. But the model sounds like it would need to be quite smart. Not entirely sure, would become clear with testing. 
- Also you yourself have to define what is a good note? Maybe find / make an example?

Internet Censorship.md,"Internet Censorship.md

## What:
Basically a giant [[Firewall]]. How do you avoid it? Sometimes something like [[Tor 🧅]].

- ***No Single Point of Failure:*** Store multiple copies, add multiple paths. There's lots of redundancies. 
- ***Collateral Damage:*** We want to intertwine something genuinely useful with the thing that's likely to be taken down. Hopefully, the adversary doesn't care enough to go through the effort of taking the useful thing down. (I.e. making your site look identical to AWS).
- ***Don't Look Suspicious:*** Pretty obvious. Try make your censor traffic look exactly like Skype or different from the censored traffic.

CDN (Content Delivery Network).md,"CDN (Content Delivery Network).md

## What
A system for quickly delivering *the same* content to users, regardless of geographic location.

### How?
- There's a central server. There are then auxiliary servers that carry [[Cache|cached webpages]] of the main server. 
- When someone requests a webpage, the request will first go the nearest CDN server and check. 
- If it's there, it will return it to the user.
- If it's not, it will go to the origin one, then set it on the CDN server then return to user. That is a pull-based one.

![[Pasted image 20240910114941.png|500]]

The rule is straight forward:

> [!seealso] Rule
> ***If***
> $$lim_{x\rightarrow a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{0}{0}$$ AND
> 
> ***Then***
> $$lim_{x\rightarrow a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = lim_{x\rightarrow a}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$

This comes from the idea that derivatives contain the idea of tiny changes. If we make a tiny change around $f(x)$ or $g(x)$ (I.E. Making $f'(x)$ or $g'(x)$), we can solve those types of limits."
Needham-Schroeder Public-Key Protocol (NSPK).md,"Needham-Schroeder Public-Key Protocol (NSPK).md

## What:
Another [[Diffie-Hellman|key-exchange]] protocol developed in 1978.

### Given:
- Alice (initiator)
- Bob (receiver)
- $K_A$ : Alice's public key
- $K_B$ : Bob's public key
- Message $\{M\}_K$ is encrypted with $K$

### Protocol Steps:
1. Alice sends Bob an encrypted message (containing a secret unique number) with his public key: 
	1. $\{A,N_A\}_{K_B}$
2. Bob responds back to the message, with his own secret unique number. He encrypts the message with Alice's public key: 
	1. $\{N_A,N_B\}_{K_A}$ (In the safer NSL version he also sends $\{N_A,N_B,B\}_{K_A}$)
	2. He sends Alice's number to confirm he got it
3. Alice responds with $\{N_B\}_{K_B}$ to confirm she's received the message. 
4. After all this, they can confirm they're both talking with each-other securely.

### Problem:
- It's susceptible to a [[Network Attack Types|Man-In-The-Middle]] attacker. Imagine inserting yourself in between Alice and Bob. Since there's no authentication, you could have a secure chat between both of them, but simply act as proxy. Boom!"

Domain Name System (DNS).md,"Domain Name System (DNS).md

How do you actually find out what [[IP Address]] is at `google.com`? The DNS protocol. It's [[TCP-IP|application-layer]]. Similar to [[Domain]], it's the `many-to-many` mapping. The [[Name Server]] are the thing that actually hold the information.

***It's actually a distributed database that stores all of the relevant records'***
- Addresses (A Record)
- Mail Exchange
- Name Server
- TTL
### Example:
`google.com` -> `216.58.213.11` and many more

## Quickly, the distributed DNS Tree:
![[Pasted image 20241002095654.png|500]]

- Every computer knows the top root node (it's hardcoded in). 
- That [[Name Server]] knows the location of all of the `.com`, `.edu`, `.org` etc. name servers. Each one of their respective ones knows all of the domains within their name servers. 
- Eventually, you'll get a name server (eg. `dns0.ed.ac.uk`) that will know the exact IP of a domain. That's the ***authoritative name server***.

## How does Iterative Name Resolution Work?
1. Your computer wants to find out where `google.com` is. It asks the nearest name server (likely your ISPs). If (for some weird reason), your ISP doesn't have it, it will ask the DNS tree. Each request has a unique ID (cos these name servers also have to serve many other people - not just you).
	1. The ***Root Server*** (root node on the tree) is likely hardcoded in your computer - there's only about 20. One's run by ICANN, another by NASA lol. 
3. Your ISP asks the Root Server of the DNS tree where `.com` is.
4. It will respond. You then ask that server where's `Google.com`. It says *""No idea, but here's `ns0.google.com`""*. 
5. You then ask `ns0.google.com` where `google.com` is, and it'll tell you!
	1. In this case, `ns0.google.com` is the ***authoritative name server*** for `google.com`
	2. `dns0.ed.ac.uk` is the authoritative name server for `ed.ac.uk`
6. In all of this, the ISP [[Cache|caches]] the records it received.


![[Pasted image 20241002095354.png]]

### Recursive Name Resolution:
Similar vibe, except the servers do the searching for you. Notice that this way, all of the name servers learn about the full domain on the way. ***TODO: NEEDS CLARIFICATION*** 

![[Pasted image 20241002095923.png]]



### Distribution of Responsibility
So in reality, ICANN manages the root of the tree. They give specific *registrars* the responsibility to manage the `.com` or `.edu` or `.uk`. Then they (`.com` registrars for example) will be in charge of giving out the `google.com`. This helps avoid name collisions.

### Encoder:"
Standard Error.md,"Standard Error.md

### What:
How can you ever be sure that your data (and in turn calculations) are accurate in [[Statistics]], like when calculating the [[Parameters of a Distribution]]? You can't. So you introduce a Standard Error. That is is a number (a tool really) that lets you know how sure you can be about your result. The formula is:

$$SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$ Where:
- $p$ is the sample proportion
- $n$ is the sample size

### Z Scores
Once you get the Standard Error, you can plug it into a normal distribution table (like the one in the Irish Formula and Tables booklet). That is then the confidence you have in your proportion's success rate / whatever you're trying to calculate."
Sound.md,"Sound.md

## What:
Sound, in [[Physics]] is a ***[[Wave]]***. Waves, remember, have certain properties:
- Frequency - refers to pitch
- Amplitude - volume / loudness


## Representing Sound:
#### As a Waveform:
![[Pasted image 20241207102536.png|300]]
- Imagine that's a 10 second clip of me speaking. `x-axis` refers to a given point of time.
- `y-axis` refers to amplitude of wave at that point in time.
- Frequency is amount of peaks in a given point of time.
- This is referred to as ***analog sound***.
- Also fairly easy to normalise from this. 

#### As Spectrogram:
- Colour (`dBFS` - decibels relative to full scale)
- Darker spots are typically silence. 
- Every word is split up into [[Phonemes]], which each have their own frequency patterns. 

![[Pasted image 20241207103537.png|500]]

### Measuring it:
When measuring digital sound, we split it into *""samples""*. This is simply a measurement of the audio's [[Wave|amplitude]] at that point in time."

## How Does C Code Run?
1. The [[Memory Hierarchy|compiler]] turns C code into [[(MIPS) Assembly Language|assembly]] code. 
2. The [[(MIPS) Assembly Language|assembler]] converts assembly code into machine code.
3. The ***Linker*** takes required libraries and adds it to a single final executable. 
4. The ***loader*** sets up [[Address Space]] in memory and loads the first instruction into memory. 
5. The [[CPU - Processor Components|CPU]] interprets the instructions, with `%eip` doing the job of the `PC - Program Counter` in MIPS."
Live CD Attacks on Memory.md,"Live CD Attacks on Memory.md

## Setup:
- `Pagefile.sys`: The file that acts as an extension to [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually|physical memory]]. 
- `hiberfil.sys`: Stores [[Virtual Memory|contents of RAM]] when system is in hibernation mode.
- `swapfile.sys`: The [[Swap Space]]. In other words, stores data from non active processes to optimise system performance. 

## The Attack? (Overly specific isn't it):
1. Boot off the computer. Info is thus stored in memory temporarily
2. Boot with a different OS using a CD.
3. Retrieve the files mentioned, as they likely have sensitive info.

1. Suppose $x$ is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of $X$,
2. Show that $x$ is an element of $Y$

- Prove $X \subseteq Y$
- Prove $Y \subseteq X$

AKA: Two's Complement Representation. 
### What's it all about?
Ok. This is all about being able to represent a [[Binary]] number as a negative. This is fucking hard. You can end up just making 0 be both positive or negative if you're not careful (1's complement). 

### How, simply?
You have a number in binary, and if there's leading 0's, it's positive, leading 1's it's negative. 

![[Screenshot 2023-09-25 at 1.42.16 p.m..png|400]]

### The Creator:
[[John Von Neumann]] was a bit of a G (according to lecturer, who is also a G).

### The Theory
##### Setup:
It's based off the idea that $X + (-X) = 0$. You represent the negation of X as the max number you can represent, minus the decimal for X (Example below). For example: Say we have a *3 bit* system and are dealing with the number 2 ($010$ binary). 
##### Find Negative:
To find $-2$, we get the highest possible number we can represent with *4 bits* (3 bits +1 for sign), and take take 2 away from that (in Decimal). In practise:
- $8 -2 = 6$ (dec) $\equiv 110$ (binary)
- $\therefore$ the binary for $-2$ in a 3 bit system is $110$. 

##### Confirm:
> $X + (-X) = 0 \equiv 110 + 010 = 1000$.
> Since it's a 3 bit system, we only check the 3 LSB's $\therefore 000 \equiv 0$. 
### How to do it?
Simple! How do you do it? Take the bits, flip them, and add one to the binary digit. 
##### EG:
- $X = 010$ (bin) -> 2 (dec)
- Flipped:  $=101$.
- Add 1: $110$. 

### Advantages:
- You don't have to design any special hardware with extra bits
- All operations are just addition with extra steps

### Drawbacks:
> The range of possible representations is not symmetric (thanks a lot 0). How does this show up / present itself? In a 4-bit word, the largest possible [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually|word]] is 0111 (7), the smallest negative is 1000 (8)

Also:
> It also has a funky way of [[Data Overflow]]. A positive overflow produces a negative number. A negative *underflow* produces a positive overflow. 


### Addition
It's not really that hard. You just have to be careful about overflow. A neat tip. If you have a carry in to the most significant bit and don't have one out (and vice versa), then you have an overflow problem. I.E. If the *carry in* to the MSB $\neq$ *carry out*, then you have an overflow"

What's the infrastructure required to bridge smart models and operating in the world?

	- ***Advanced:*** For those with a better grasp of concepts, we held reading and discussion groups, reading the latest papers and tools like [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy)!


- ***EdinburghAI Expo:*** Our flagship event is a *science-fair-like* event. It works like so:
	- Students apply at the start of the school year. 
	- They choose a project (given a [rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Og-5sb80sQZB22dMDoYmqZHs5oVK3MA/view)) and start to build a project they think would do well!
	- On the day of the event, academia, industry, students and researchers alike come together and view the projects on display. 
	- The projects will be judged on the day and the top teams will win some sweet prizes (first place 2024 was £1000 🤑).

Data Overflow.md,"Data Overflow.md

### Definition:
When data exceeds the space allotted for it, spills into the storage ([[(Computer) Memory Conceptually|memory]], [[OS Memory Management (x86)|memory in x86]]) for something else and causes something unexpected to happen. Can cause corruption, data loss and vulnerabilities (E.G. [[Buffer Overflow Attack]])."
Solids of Revolution.md,"Solids of Revolution.md

### Concept:
Imagine you had a function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$, with domain $[0,3]$. Visualise that. Now, imagine the lower end is stuck on a swivel and you pluck the top end and rotate it around the x-axis, leaving a wall as it passes. The solid you just created is a ***solid of revolution***. 

### Finding A(x)
Now the fun part. How do you calculate the volume of it? First, what's the $A(x)$ (*the area*) of a cross section of the shape? Well, it's a circle, the radius is $\sqrt{x}$. $\therefore A(x)=\pi(\sqrt{x})^{2}=\pi x$.

![[Screenshot 2023-08-05 at 11.40.06 a.m..png]]

### Finding Volume:
Using [[Volume by Slicing]], we can pretty easily find it now. Just integrate, plugging in $A(x)$ instead of just $x$. 

### What about harder shapes?
Well most of the time you won't get something as simple as a single function around the x-axis (which gives you a nice and convenient cross sectional area). Instead, you'll more often be asked to calculate the volume of a solid that was created from revolution of the area enclosed by 2 functions (take $f(x)=x$ and $g(x)=x^2$. This looks like the below. The area enclosed is called a washer:
![[Screenshot 2023-08-05 at 12.07.16 p.m..png]]

Thus the formula for the **Cross Sectional Area** (applied to the question from screenshot):  $A(x)=\pi r_{outer}^{2} - \pi r_{inner}^{2} = \pi(x)^{2}-\pi((x)^{2})^{2}=\pi(x^2-x^4)$"
Sequences.md,"Sequences.md

### What:
An ***infinitely ordered list***. The items in it are called ***terms***. EG:
- Sequence of natural numbers: $1,2,3,4,5,...$
- Scores I got when infinitely rolling die: $1,4,2,5,2,...$
- A sum of the subset of terms is called [[Series]]
- 

### Describing a pattern as a formula:
- In the following: 
	- $a$ is the first term
	- $d$ is the common difference
	- $r$ is common ratio (i.e. $T_n/T_{n-1}$)
- For *arithmetic sequences* (constant first difference): 
	- $T_n = a + (n-1)d$
	- $S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a + (n-1)d]$
- For *geometric sequences* (constant second difference):
	- $T_n = ar^{n-1}$
	- $S_n = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$
	- $S_\infty = \frac{a}{1-r}$ (Given $|r| \lt 1$)
``

### Different Types of Sequences
##### Increasing, Decreasing, and Monotone Sequences

A sequence ${a_n}$ is increasing for all $n \geq n_0$ if
$$
a_n \leq a_{n+1} \text{ for all } n \geq n_0.
$$
I.E. if a term is followed by a bigger term every time.


A sequence ${a_n}$ is decreasing for all $n \geq n_0$ if
$$
a_n \geq a_{n+1} \text{ for all } n \geq n_0.
$$
I.E. every term is followed by a lesser term. 


A sequence ${a_n}$ is a monotone sequence for all $n \geq n_0$ if it is increasing for all $n \geq n_0$ or decreasing for all $n \geq n_0$.

I.E. After a certain point, the monotone sequence doesn't change direction."

Key Ideas:"
Productivity.md,"Productivity.md

> [!caution] The Productivity Trap
> ***Actually working inefficiently > spending that time trying to optimise for marginal gains.*** Start working and [[Compound Effect|iteratively]] experiment upwards. I used to be terrible for spending most of my time doing the latter.

### How to be Productive?
- ***Just Start:*** Don't paralyse yourself by trying to globally optimise everything. Just start. You're better off doing something sub-optimally then staying at the beginning *(which is technically optimal lol).* 

- ***Experiment Ruthlessly, Endlessly:*** Everyone works differently. This also ties into [[Productivity|learning]]. Experiment with every potential variable. Track the results.
	- Try more/less hours of sleep.
	- Try caffeine / no breakfast / breakfast.
	- Try different notetaking methods. Try handwritten or digital.
	- Try learning by building. Try learning by watching lectures only. Try not watching lectures at all. 
	- I found I learn best with good sleep, trying to teaching others and spaced repetition, but you could be different. Never stop experimenting with new methods as well!

- ***Take Care of Yourself:*** Drink lots of water. Exercise. 

- ***Snowball your efforts:*** Work on something really hard for a long period of time. Do it for long enough, and the effects will make you immeasurably better. Ties into [[Compound Effect]]."
Data Parallelism.md,"Data Parallelism.md

### What:
- Parallelising the training data and splitting it up amongst GPU's
- Each GPU computes gradients ([[(Machine Learning) Models|loss]]) independently
- Gradients are averaged to update model
- Allows scaling with multiple GPUs and minimal code changes"
Cruise.md,"Cruise.md

The company that makes [[Autonomous Vehicles]]. They're pretty sick. Based in Silicon Valley."
Injection Attacks.md,"Injection Attacks.md

## What:
Attacker's malicious input is not validated and the server runs it. Think SQLInjection, command injection. 
### Command Injection:
```python
import os

def ping_host(host):
    # Executes the ping command using user input
    command = f""ping -c 4 {host}""
    os.system(command)

```
Could be exploited by:
```python
example.com; rm -rf /
```

### SQL Injection:
```python
import sqlite3

def authenticate_user(username, password):
    # Connect to the database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('users.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Vulnerable query construction
    query = f""SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'""
    cursor.execute(query)
    
    # Fetch the result
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    return result is not None
```

If I provide: 
- ***username:*** `admin' --`
- ***password:*** `anything`

Then the query becomes:
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'anything`
Since -- is the comment, then all of the details will be returned, regardless of if you had the right password. 
`"
Supervised Learning.md,"Supervised Learning.md

- You give the model both **input data** and **desired outputs**.
   - Examples:
     - Predicting house prices from size. ([[Simple Linear Regression]], [[Multiple Linear Regression]])
     - Classifying emails as spam or not spam. (**Classification**)
   - Relies heavily on the availability of labelled data."
Computer Security.md,"Computer Security.md

## What're the fundamentals?
***CIA*** is the core 3. Similar (but different) to [[CAP - Brewer's Theorem|CAP]]:
- ***Confidentiality***: Information should only be accessible to authorised entities (links to *Authenticity*). 
- ***Integrity:***
	- Data is untampered and uncorrupted
- ***Availability:***
	- Accessible when you need it. 
- **Authentication**
- ***[[Anonymity]]***
- **Unlinkability:** An attacker should not be able to deduce whether different services are delivered to the same user.
- **Non-repudiation**: The author of an action should not be able to deny doing said action.

## Security Threat Categories
- Interception
- Interruption
- Modification
- Fabrication
- Repudiation
- Epistemic

## Security Principals:
- ***Defence in Depth***: Like a castle, build multiple layers of the of security. If one fails, another acts as redundancy / reduces impacts. 
	- EG: Firewalls, intrusion detection, network segmentation, antivirus, least privilege etc.
- ***Least Privilege***: Users / programs should only have access to what's required. 
- ***[[Privilege Separation]]***: Segment the system into components which can be accessed. EG apps need distinct permissions.
- ***Open Design:*** Avoiding security through obscurity. 
- ***Economy of Mechanism:*** Keep a security mechanism simple.
- ***Fail-Safe Defaults:*** The default should be conservative. Eg New users should have least privileges.
- ***Complete Mediation:*** Every access to a resource should be checked for compliance with security policy. 

## Security Goals in Web Browsers:
- Web apps should provide the same security guarantees as normal apps.
1. `evil.com` shouldn't infect the rest of my computer
2. `evil.com` shouldn't compromise my `gmail.com` session
3. Sensitive info on `gmail.com` should be kept that way.

Virtual Memory.md,"Virtual Memory.md

Another key part in the space of [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually]]. 
### Basically: 

##### Background:
Alright. In a 32 bit machine, we could have potentially $2^{32}-1$ memory addresses. But what if you only have $1GB$ of [[DRAM]]? What if I want to have a bunch of programs open as well, more so than I would be able to with the measly $1GB$ of RAM? 
##### Solution:
We solve this by sandboxing each program, and allocating it a spot in our [[Address Space|Virtual Address Space]]. We then map each program onto a place in actual physical real memory. Virtual Memory is divided into blocks of data called [[Pages (Virtual Memory)]]. Each program thinks it's at the beginning of physical memory. Also, to map the virtual memory to physical memory, we use a [[Page Table]]. Every program ***thinks*** it has its own PT. 
###### Example:
If we keep swapping between Safari, Obsidian and VSCode, but left Adobe PDF reader on the background, Adobe would likely get swapped to the hard-disk, while the other 3 are left in RAM. If we want to use it, we'd simply swap it in and maybe move Safari to the main disk (if there's no space left in Physical memory). This is the exact reason computers with more RAM feel faster when switching between programs, because they don't have to load it up from hard disk as they're *all* stored in physical memory.

(Computer) Bit.md,"(Computer) Bit.md

Fun fact. It stands for Binary Digit

[[Data Representation or Types|Representing Data]] as bits is a great way of doing it. It's extremely reliable, simple and reusable. It would be such a balls to use circuits as tertiaries etc. 

[[Binary]] is a way of representing information with bits. You learned how to do this in secondary school. It's quite easy."
Mechanistic Interpretability.md,"Mechanistic Interpretability.md

Science naturally works by inspecting interesting things. But we have to build (or find) those things in the first place."
Turing Test.md,"Turing Test.md

Alan Turing was famously one of the greatest computer scientists of the world. That was before he was chemically castrated and sent to prison for being gay (WW2 were some weird times). 

### What was it?
He came up with his eponymous test to measure a machine's *""intelligence""*. Roughly speaking:

>[!tldr] What was it?
> If someone could converse with a machine, in a text conversation, for a sustained period of time and *not realise* they were conversing with a robot, it would be declared to have passed the test. 

But with the rise of [[Large Language Models (LLMs)]], what good is that? They've clearly passed, but no one is calling them ""*intelligent*"". Cue the modern TT:

> [!note] Turing Test 2.0
> *If you can give a machine an ambiguous, open-ended, complex goal that requires interpretation, judgement, creativity, decision making and acting across multiple domains, then it's said to have completed the test.* (M. Suleyman, [[The Coming Wave]])
> 
> For example, if I told it to ""*Make me €1million on Amazon*"", it would research what it has to do, the best marketing campaign, use image generation to make it etc.

## Takeaways:
- The world is going to be amazing. There's a few things that could stop us from getting there though (eg alignment, WW3) and we need to work on preventing those things.
- Imagine an AI who could help you navigate everything you're entitled to by the government - in a way that you can understand. That would be a big deal..."

1. First, convert the FPN from base 10 to base 2. 
	- $0.75 \equiv 0.11$
	- $0.11 = 0.5+0.25$
		1. Normalise it:
	- $1.1\times 2^{-1}$
	- Why normalise?
		- Simplifies Machine Representation (you don't need a fraction separator)
		- Simplifies Comparisons
		- Compact for very large/small numbers
	- Meaning of exponent:
		- How much over to shift the decimal point. 
	- Mantissa (significand) is the (only binary) number after the point. Eg: 1 
3. Take the exponent and add the bias:
	- -1 +127 (Bias) = 126. 
	- Convert exponent to binary: 01111110.
4. Putting it all together:
	- 0 01111110 10000000000000000000000

Privilege Separation.md,"Privilege Separation.md

## What
It's a [[Computer Security]] concept that prevents misbehaving users / applications from harming the rest of the system. Remember, computers are both multiuser and multitasking!

### How?
First we must ask **""*Who* is allowed to access *what* and *how*?""**. *Note:* We assume the user is authenticated and that *every* requests is mediated - a *reference monitor* enforced specified access controls.  

##### Types of Users:
Each have a *user ID* - `uid`.
1. User accounts
2. Service accounts
You can also group them into... groups. Groups have *group ID* - `gid`. 

##### File Permissions:
Resources (sockets, directories, files) are all managed with:
- read (***r***), write (***w***) and execute (***x***) permissions
- Permissions are defined by the owner of the file. Only root and owner can change them. 
- Only root can change file ownership. 

### Elevating Privileges
Imagine an executable file (owned by Bob) with `setuid` enabled. If Alice executes the file, then the `euid` is Bob's, not Alice's. This makes writing `setuid` files tricky 

### Unix's Approach:
All applications installed by a single user account has the same privileges. It's better to delegate capabilities associated with specific root powers. IOS, for example, has per action permissions (eg apps need to request locations, camera and health separately)."

- **Sharding**: You split up the data into multiple different databases, and ensure the indexing matches.
- **Replication:** Basically, just have multiple different databases with identical information.

Local Extrema.md,"Local Extrema.md

Quite a simple concept that's overcomplicated in the course. Take an interval $I$. Take a point $c$ in it. 

***Local Max:*** If $f(c)$ is the highest point in that interval $I$. (I.E. $f(c) >= f(x)$, where $x$ is any other point in $I$)

Prime Vs Composite.md,"Prime Vs Composite.md

How to [[Proofs|prove]] if something is a prime or a composite (made up of a few smaller things?)

### The definition you're used to, complicated:
> $n$ is prime $\iff$ $n > 1$ *and* for all positive integers $r$ and $s$, if $n=rs$ then either $r$ or $s$ is $n$.

Basically:
n is prime iff one of the factors of n is n itself (and the other is 1 obviously). 
![[Screenshot 2023-09-21 at 5.33.04 p.m..png]]
### Definition of Composite:

Converting Function to Power Series.md,"Converting Function to Power Series.md

### What:
Sometime's you may get a function in the form $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^3}$ and want it in a [[Power Series]] representation. 

### How to convert Function to Power Series:
Remember, by definition of the sum of an [[Sequences|infinite sequence]], a series: $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}ar^n = a + ar + ar^{2 + \ldots}= \frac{a}{1-r}$$
when $|r|\lt 1$. Use this fact to manipulate a function into the RHS of above. You can then extract $a$ and $r$ and put them in the form of the LHS.

From here, you can pretty easily find the [[Radius of Convergence]]."

Calculating Arc Length.md,"Calculating Arc Length.md

So we know we can use [[Integration]] to calculate the area under a curve. But what about calculating the *arc length of a function's curve*? 

### Same trick, new application
Ok so we know that [[Calculus]] is all about taking tiny, easy to work with, things and using those to solve a harder problem. This is no different. Imagine a function $f(x)=x^2$ . You want to calculate the length from $[2,5]$ . In signature Calculus fashion, we'll take that length and break it up into tiny bits, before eventually summing them all up. Let's call the tiny bits $ds$.

We can represent $ds$ as the hypotenuse of a triangle with corresponding sides $dx$ and $dy$. That looks like the below:

The formula is also there. I prefer to use the bottom right connotation/"
First Order Linear Differential Equations.md,"First Order Linear Differential Equations.md

Yehhh... I know it sounds quite hard, but it's really not that complicated. They're equations that come in the form:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x)
$$

To solve this, you'll need an ""integrating factor"". Firstly, the integrating factor is $\mu (x)=e^{\int{p(x)dx}}$. We do this because we're next going to multiply everything by it, so we end up with the LHS in the form:
$$
\mu(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + \mu(x)p(x)y
$$
Note: This looks a lot like the expansion of the product rule (Derivative = $f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$). Thus, you can turn the LHS into $\mu(x)y$."

Registers.md,"Registers.md

### What?
Little dedicated storages for small bits of data (EG For program variables and control state). [[MIPS (Architecture)]] processes operate on registers only. 

Registers are generally sized to contain a machine's word (32/64 bit - 32bit for [[MIPS (Architecture)]]). What's this? The standard size of data that the [[ISA (Architecture)]] is designed to handle efficiently. 

### Layout:
Within a register, data is stored. Each entry of data is typically 32 bits. Thus the *byte* address is typically also given. The fact each entry is stored in bytes (multiples of 8) is called and ***Alignment Restriction***. 

### What happens when variables > registers?
If a program has more variables than chip has registers, the values in the registers get *spilled* into [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually]]. This is less than ideal. 

### Actually what is it in [[Digital Circuits]]:
It's a bunch of [[Combinational and Sequential Logic Blocks|d flip-flops]] strung together using a common clock."
Loop Invariant.md,"Loop Invariant.md

### What?

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).md,"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).md

## What:
We designed this system of [[Reinforcement Learning|RL]] (albeit very weak form of RL) to keep [[AI]] models [[Alignment|aligned]] to human values. 

### How?
1. Models go through their normal [[AI Pretraining|pretraining]]. Now models are able to come up with coherent text.
2. Now this is imperfect - it outputs stuff against our values. The solution? Fine-tune it! Ok... But how? 
	1. Using human annotators, rank possible outputs from the models in terms of quality.
	2. Take these outputs, and ***train another model*** to ***be*** a human annotator... We'll call this the *reward model*. 
	3. The reward model can now judge the base model based on human preferences. 
3. We fine tune the base model, using RL with an algorithm called [[Proximal Policy Optimisation]]. This encourages positive, human aligned text. 
4. To ensure we don't lose the coherence of the original base model, we add a penalty for losing coherence. 

## Controversy 👀:
Andrej Karpathy has [shat](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1821277264996352246) on RLHF, saying it's basically not RL. Honestly, I'm inclined to agree. Basically:
1. The Reward Model looks at the LLM's output. Based on it's general vibe (*as decreed by humans*), it encourages / discourages it. It's a crappy proxy (as opposed to the better but abstract goal of *""Reward it based on how 'correct' it was""* - what does it mean to be correct?). 
2. You also don't get the creativity of RL. It's the traditional AlphaGo vs AlphaZero."

Permutations.md,"Permutations.md

### Side Topic:
If you have $k$ selections, with replacement, from a set of $n$ distinct objects (E.G. 6 sides of a die), then the size of the [[Sample Space]] is $n^k$. So the total amount of possible outcomes for rolling a dice 3 times is $6^3$. (Technically if you get a side of the die, you replace it again for the next roll).

### Permutations: That, but without replacement. 
> [!note] Formal Definition:
> Any ordered sequence of $k$ objects taken without replacement from a set of $n$ distinct objects is called a permutation of size $k$ of the objects. The number of permutations of size $k$ that can be constructed from the $n$ objects is denoted by $_nP_k$.
>
> $$_nP_k = n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-k+2)(n-k+1)$$ OR
> $$_nP_{k}= \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$

Modular Exponentiation.md,"Modular Exponentiation.md

A tough challenge that requires [[Efficiency in Algorithms]]:

Given large numbers $a$, $n$, $m$, compute $a^2 mod m$. (This is a challenge in [[RSA Algorithm]])

### A (fast) method for solving:
Note it's easy to compute $e = a^n \mod m$ if we've already computed $d=a^{n/2}$
- If n is even, take $e = (d \times d) \mod m$
- if n is odd, take $e = (d \times d \times a) \mod m$
Thus this is a [[Recursive Algorithm]] solution."

What is intelligence? Is it a uniquely human characteristic? What happens when [[AI]] can perform as many tasks on the internet as a collection of experts could? Is that machine now intelligent? Where does that leave humans?

The human brain is a computer. It has 100 trillion neurons, with 100 trillion connections in between them. This is a hard concrete number. This is theoretically surpassable (relatively soon as well due to the [[Compound Effect]] of [[Technology]]).

Direct-Mapped Cache.md,"Direct-Mapped Cache.md

A type of [[Cache]]: Unlike [[Fully Associative Cache]], where finding tags is slow, blocks here are determined to be in a specific location, determined by its address. Dats has a specific place in memory, as determined by the data's (main memory) address. This is done with the use of indices. 


![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 12.55.17 p.m..png|400]]

### Indexing with DMC:
1. Take a random 32 bit address. 
2. The Byte Offset depends on how many addresses there are *within* each data block. 
3. The index refers to which location of cache each data block is.
	1. *To find amount of possible indices*: If you have $x$kB of cache space, and $y$ Byte data blocks, then it's $\frac{x}{y}$
	2. *To find amount of bits needed to represent*: $\frac{x}{y} = 2^i$ -> $i$ is the desired amount of bits to represent it.


### Slight Problems with DMC:
- Simple hardware -> Fast and lower power
- Blocks map to same locations -> Increased miss rates"

CAP - Brewer's Theorem.md,"CAP - Brewer's Theorem.md

## What:
Basically, you can only have **two of the following three** in a distributed system. (*Note: It's never so black and white - you'll often have degree's of severity for the below)*:
- **Partition Tolerance**
- **Consistency**
- **Availability**

![[Pasted image 20240909162041.png|300]]
#### Partition Tolerance:
Inevitable, [[Distributed System Architecture|distributed system]] ***will fail***. Partition Tolerance refers to how the system is able to operate, even without 

#### Consistency:
**All clients accessing the system would see all of the *same data* at the *same time***, regardless of the node of the system they're accessing.

#### Availability:
This refers to the ability for a system to **respond to all requests at all times**.

### Example:
![[Pasted image 20240909153212.png]]Imagine an incredibly simple bank. They've only got 2 ATMs, and all information is stored locally on those ATMs. Imagine those 2 ATMs suddenly lost connection (*Partition tolerance*), but the system did not combust into flames. The bank has 2 options:

1. **Be *Consistent*:** They could prohibit users from withdrawing / depositing money, until the ATMs are able to communicate again (but the service *would not be available*). The ATMs would have consistent balances though. 
2. **Be *Available*:** They could enable users to withdraw/deposit, but the balances in the machines would not be consistent. (This would actually cause shit to hit the fan even worse - cos imagine the balance is not consistent and then 1 person takes money from both ATMs).

### Example 2:
For a social media website commenting feature, it's an acceptable design choice to limit consistency (users don't see the same comment) so that users are all able to access it regardless."
Hash Table.md,"Hash Table.md

### What are they all about?
The easiest way to think of them is like a [[Python]] Dictionary. (In fact, in Python, they're coded using Hash Tables). In other words:
- A [[Data Structures|collection]] of *Key:Value* pairs. Keys cannot appear more than once.
- They can be of any type.

### The Keys are hella Techy:
Smart people made ways of accessing them by keys super efficient. It works as follows:
- A hash table is initialised, with a bunch of empty slots (boxes where data and its corresponding values will go).
- If you want to add a key, say ""Jane"", it undergoes a hashing algorithm. This is much simpler and less [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] than something like SHA-256 ([[Cryptographic Hash Functions]]). 
	- This can be as simple as as taking $k\ mod\ m$, where $m$ is the length of the (current) table and key is the (integer representation of the) key. The result would be the key.
- Accessing a value in the Hash Table is $\Theta(1)$. 
- If the table crosses a threshold of $x$ (typically $0.7$), then a new table is created and copied over. The expansion may seem inefficient, but the [[Amortised Cost]] is reasonable.

### What if the Hash Function produces a key already in use?
This is known as a ***collision***. It's inevitable really. The key to making a Hash Function quick is dealing with these quickly. A simple way of solving this is just skip to the next empty slot and throw it in there. But there's many algorithms for handling collisions.

Kernel Vs User Mode.md,"Kernel Vs User Mode.md

> [!warning] What:
> It would be incredibly dangerous to allow users to willy-nilly handle memory. Thus, the [[CPU - Processor Components|CPU]] is split into 2 modes: ***Kernel*** and ***User***, trusted and untrusted respectively. The [[Operating System (OS)]] is in charge of splitting between the two. 

## Modes:
- ***Kernel:*** A software layer directly on top of the hardware that *controls / restricts* the secure sharing of low-level resources between users/applications.
- ***Execution Modes:*** 
	- *User Mode:* Can't actually directly call resources, so install invokes `syscall`, which temporarily switches to kernel mode. 
	- *Kernel Mode:* Direct access to computer resources
		- ***Privileged*** instructions (accessing I/O devices, handling page table, etc) only executable in *Kernel* mode.
		- Only *enterable* through `syscalls` (eg `read()` in [[C (Programming Language)|C]], [[Operating System (OS)|OS]]). 
		- `eret` instruction sets mode back to previous mode. 

### Advantages:
- Ensures programs don't interfere with each other - only have access to the the resources for which they have permission"
Buffer Overflow Attack.md,"Buffer Overflow Attack.md

## What?
Remember, a [[Data Overflow]] overwrites data in memory. How do we actually take advantage of that, and redirect the overflow to the malicious code?

## How?
Before the code, remember that whenever you [[The Stack's Use in MIPS|dive into a function]], you store the return address on the stack (reminder of what [[Address Space]] looks like). What if you could rewrite the return address to be that of something malicious? Or what if the attacker just input the (malicious) machine code as the attackers input? When the [[OS Running Source Code|%eip]] or [[(MIPS) Assembly Language|program counter]] reaches it, it runs. 

Take the below code:
```c

void vulnerable_function(char *input) {
    char buffer[8];
    strcpy(buffer, input);  // No bounds checking here, so buffer overflow is possible
}

int main() {
    char *malicious_input = ""AAAAAAAABBBBCCCCDDDD\xef\xbe\xad\xde"";  // Includes overflow and the new return address (of something malicious).
    vulnerable_function(malicious_input);
    return 0;
}
```

### The Struggle is Real (I.E. how do we actually get the return address):
It's hard to actually know what location your malicious code is at (and thus what to set the return address to). 
- If we know what the code looks like, we know exactly how big the buffer is (and thus what's *too* big). 
- If we didn't know what the code looks like, we know all [[Address Space|32 bit]] machines are only capable of $2^{32}-1$ addresses. What if we tried every one?
- If we know the rough address  (i.e. the approximate size of the stack), we could create a `NOP` (No Operation) sled. This is basically padding before the attack so if the `Return Address` lands on it, it will slide down to the relevant code.

### Some [[C (Programming Language)|C]] Culprits:
None of these do bounds checking. The programmer has to add checks:
- `strcpy` - Copies the line from a variable into something
- `strcat` - Concats 2 lines together.
- `gets` - reads line from somewhere into a variable
- `scanf`

## Defenses:
- ***Stack Canaries:*** a small, *random* value placed (randomly) between local variables and control data (eg return address). If the canary gets altered, the program stops prematurely. 
	- If the attacker learns (or guesses) the value of the canary, they can rewrite the stack but maintain the value of it.
	- If the attacker learns the location, they could jump over it on the stack
	- Doesn't work against heap overflows(?)

- ***Data Execution Protection:*** Makes certain parts of the stack non-executable. Even if the attacker can add malicious code to the stack, they can't run it. 
	- What if the attacker doesn't inject new code, simply refers to other insecure code.

- ***Write XOR Execute:*** The stack will always either be Writable or Executable but never both at the same time. 
	- Again, just reuse old unsafe C code. 

- ***Address Space Location Randomisation (ASLR):*** Prevent the attacker from knowing where things are in memory. Place standard library things (eg `exec()` etc.) in random locations."

> [!danger] Note!
> This note was originally written for cache in a computer. But the concept is a popular one in CS. For example, this is incredibly common for [[Distributed System Architecture]], for Server Caching, Database Caching etc.
### What?
- Small, fast [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually|memory]], very close to [[CPU - Processor Components|processor]]. Takes heavy advantage of [[Memory Hierarchy]]. 
### Terms:
- ***Block*** (or ***line***): Typically a collection of words (aka group of contiguous memory locations), corresponding to blocks of main memory. 
- ***Hit***: Data is found (good thing)
- ***Miss***: Data not found
	- Continue search at next level of memory
	- After data is eventually found, it's copied to the memory level where the miss happened (optimise *temporal locality*). 
- ***Hit Rate/Ratio***: Fraction of accesses that are hits at a given level.
- ***Miss Rate***:  `1 - Hit Rate`
- ***Allocation***: Placement of a new block into cache, typically resulting in the eviction of another. 
- ***Eviction***: Displacement of a block from the cache. 
- Index

### Cache Replacement Algorithm:
- Least Recently Used
- First In First Out
### Writing to Cache:
##### On a hit:
- ***Writing Through***: When you write it to cache, also write it to memory.
	- Always synchronised but writes are slow and require memory bandwidth
- ***Write Back***: Write to cache only
	- Only when the block of cache is evicted do we store it / change the main memory. 
	- Writes are thus fast but main memory has stale cache for a while.  
##### On a miss:
- ***Write Allocate***: Bring the block into cache and write to it 
- ***Write No-Allocate***: Do not bring the block into cache, simply modify the data in memory only.
	- Quicker if there's no locality

### Different Types of Cache:
- [[Fully Associative Cache]]
- [[Direct-Mapped Cache]]
- [[Set Associative Cache]]

### Programming Before ChatGPT Era?
Someone recently asked me: 

***""Are you a better coder with ChatGPT?""***

That's the wrong question. In fact, the entire premise is wrong. 

---

What did it mean to be a good programmer before ChatGPT? It was based entirely on how well you could *ideate, build, debug errors, Google answers, and iterate*. 

A non-trivial part of the process is *learning what to do when you're faced with an error*. There's two kinds of errors: the scary-red-lines type and the more subtle logic and implementation errors. When faced with the first, a novice programmer will grapple with common pitfalls *(off-by-one errors)*, or the quirks of the language *(pointers vs. direct values, object manipulation)*. When faced with these issues, you learn how to interpret the errors, Google answers and how to read and write in that specific programming language. 

Subtle logic and implementation errors are harder. Maybe your algorithm works perfectly *most* of the time. Or your app is too slow when retrieving from the database. Or you're burning through API credits and have to make your system more efficient. When faced with these kinds of issues, you learn how to problem-solve. You learn how to recognise if a problem even exists. You learn how to use debugging tools like breakpoints *(\*cough\* print statements \*cough\*)*. You learn how to diagram a *""better""* solution, how to design more performant systems, how to organise and structure your code and *much, much more*. 

Notably, this all takes time. The timeline for *idea $\rightarrow$ product* is *""slowed down""* by all of the learning done\*. 

Before ChatGPT, it was difficult and inefficient to build something novel and simultaneously skip the learning steps. 

*\*Note: Those learnings will eventually pay dividends. More on that later.* 

---
### Programming After ChatGPT Era:
Today *(December, '24)*, the programming landscape looks different. If you want to build something, a *potential* process could look like:

1. Ideate
2. Craft a prompt describing what code you want.
3. Take the generated code, run it and note any errors / improvements.
4. Craft another prompt to iterate over.

While this exact process will likely be dated soon, the key idea remains: ***Programming skill** is increasingly about how well you can ideate and ""prompt"" in new improvements\*. You no longer need to learn how to interpret errors and traditionally problem solve to build something\*\*.* 


*\*Note: Prompting and iterating with a language model is not a trivial task. To get the most performance out of a model, you should learn the how to write in language they best respond to (i.e. prompt engineer), or analyse where they often fall short. Albeit you don't **need** to learn this to build a product (even in December '24). But your ceiling of ability of heavily constrained on how well you can work **with** the models.*

*\*\*Note: Cursor (an AI-first code-editor) has a dedicated button(!) to feed a given error into a Language Model and get a potential solution. Or the ""Chat"" functionality is just a shortcut away - simply ask a LM to change some part of the program and it will do it. Minimal (and increasingly less) debugging from you required.*

---
### This Isn't New:
Building a technological product has always had a prohibitive barrier to entry, but it's steadily fallen over time. In the early 1970s, programming often meant manually manipulating memory. Resources were limited, so every instruction mattered. Languages like C abstracted some of this complexity, and Python built on this by eliminating memory management altogether. Simply declare a variable and the language would take care of the rest. 

The specifics of how it works under-the-hood are increasingly abstracted, making it easier for developers to focus on what they want to build rather than on how to build it. AI tools like ChatGPT represent the next step in this progression.  

*After all, the hottest new programming language is English* 😉.

## We Should Value Builders Over Coders
Society has always valued people who build things other people want. But building technology has always had a prohibitive barrier to entry. As AI makes building more accessible, builders without traditional coding skills will still create.

These are [[Differential Equations|differential equations]] that, when rearranged, the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ can be arranged in the form $f(x)g(y)$. I.e:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y)$$


### How to separate variables:
##### Method 1:
- Solve for the derivative and you better get something like $xy$.
##### Method 2:
1. Check for values of $y$ that make $g(y) = 0$. These correspond to constant solutions.
2. Rewrite the differential equation in the form $\frac{dy}{g(y)} = f(x)dx$.
3. Integrate both sides of the equation.

ISA (Architecture).md,"ISA (Architecture).md

> [!warning] Architecture$^2$
> Wait! This page refers to ***hardware architecture***. It defines how software at the lowest level (eg [[(MIPS) Assembly Language|assembly]]). This is different from [[Operating System (OS)]], which focuses on designing an environment for applications to run, abstracted away from hardware details.

### What is it?
It stands for ***Instruction Set Architecture***, also known as the *Computer Architecture*. It's the set of instructions that a CPU can execute. It's the bridge between the software and the hardware. It's the equivalent of *Language* (Note: It's the concept / [[Technology]] of language not a specific one) to a computer. 

You can have different specific ISA's, like [[MIPS (Architecture)]], [[ARM (ISA)]] or [[x86]].  Each of these are just different sets of commands designed for different chipsets. You can have different flavours/implementations of individual Architectures (Dubbed [[Microarchitectures]]). This allows the industry to put out newer chips. As long as you preserve the ISA, the software will continue to run. 

### What can ISAs do?
- Abstracts away hardware details to programmers."
MIPS (Architecture).md,"MIPS (Architecture).md

> [!warning] Note:
> This page refers specifically to the architecture that is MIPS. This can include the structure of an instruction. Click here to find out more about [[(MIPS) Assembly Language]]. 
### What is it?
An actual [[ISA (Architecture)]] that's been used in billions of processors since the 80's. 

### Instructions:

- `R-type`: Used for instructions that require *2 input registers* and an *output register* (eg `sub`, `add`, `SLL` etc.)
- `i-type`: Used for instructions with *2 input registers* and a *destination address* (eg `bne`, `blez`, `lb`, `addi`, `andi`).
Since there's only a limited amount of space, we gotta make good use of them. This is what MIPS instructions look like. Sequences of instructions are called Machine Code. 

### Big-Endian:
MIPS is Big-Endian, meaning we read the bits from left to right. Not all [[ISA (Architecture)|ISAs]] are. [[Endianness]] is an important bit of memory.


There's only 4 ""Data Transfer"" Instructions.

AI Governance.md,"AI Governance.md

> [!tldr] What is this Page?
> The UK government (under Sunak) released a document on how frontier labs can be safer, as well as encouraging them to release how they're being safe at the moment. The document is [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653aabbd80884d000df71bdc/emerging-processes-frontier-ai-safety.pdf). This page is how they suggested scaling the models safely. 

## Responsible Scaling:
In order to (in the eyes of the government) be safer, a ""Responsible Scaling Framework"" for managing risks and deploying [[AI]] models. 

### 1. Risk Assessments:
- Assess risks at all points in time. Analyse factors like expert forecasts (guesses) and [[(Machine Learning) Models|model]] [[AI Benchmarks|evaluations]].
- Define specific thresholds that, if breached, require specific actions or mitigations. 
- Develop plans for if/when each threshold is exceeded.

### 2. Model Evaluations and Red Teaming:
- Evaluate models for dangerous capabilities, lack of control and [[Computer Security|security]] weaknesses.
- Constantly evaluate the models (at every point of [[AI Training]])

### 3. Information Sharing:
- Share general risk info:
	- Risk assessment processes, internal governances with government authorities. 
- Share model information (obviously hard to do)
- Share different information based on audience / stakeholders. 

### 4. Security Controls:
- The last thing we want is the weights getting stolen. Have good [[Computer Security||cybersecurity]] posture. 
- Do not enable the models to do something dangerous in the first place.

### 5. Reporting Structure:
- [[Incentives|Incentivise]] people to report vulnerabilities in AI models
	- Á la bug bounties. 
### 6. Identify AI-Generated Material:
- Research and implement robust [[AI Watermarking]] systems. 
- These should be hard to remove.

### 7. Prioritise Safety Research:
- Research [[Mechanistic Interpretability]], robustness etc. 
- Openly share the safety research. 

### 8. Monitor & Prevent Model Misuse:
- Detect misuse. 
- Filter harmful prompt
- Develop rapid response plans. 

### 9. Data Input Controls and Audits:
- *Responsible Data Collection...*
- Remove harmful data from training process.

Ok. There was a physics problem where the movement of a pendulum around a small angle was $R(1-Cos(\theta))$. And then... Just like magic, the student represented that function as $R(\frac{\theta^2}{2})$... WHATTTT???

> [!definition] What are Taylor [[Series]]?
> They're a way of representing *non-polynomials* ***as*** *polynomials*. A key point to note (that's also pretty cool about them) is that they translate **derivative** information at a *single point* to a output ***around*** that *point*.

### Taylor Series Formula:
If $f$ has derivatives, of all orders, at $f(a)$, then the Taylor series for the function $f$ at $a$ is

$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x - a)^n = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 + \ldots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x - a)^n + \ldots
$$
### Maclaurin Series:
The Taylor series for $f$ at 0 is known as the Maclaurin series for $f$. Pretty scummy to legit get a whole new name for it when Taylor did all the work but ok...

### What happens if you extend the [[Series]] out into infinity?
Well, if it only ever gets better and better at representing it, then it's known to ***converge***. Otherwise, if it hits a point on either side of the original point that it oscillates around, then it's known to ***diverge***. The points on either side are known as the ***[[Radius of Convergence]]***.

### What is it?
C is just another programming language, like [[Python]] or [[Java]]. It's different to them in a few ways though. 

### Key Distinctions:
- Not object orientated (there's no classes, just collections of functions). 
- Not interpreted (compiled into executable machine code). 
- Run time errors (like *Array Out-Of-Bounds Exception*) are not caught by compiler. They'll get caught in the program and crash the application lol.
	- This also can lead to security vulnerabilities. 
- There's only data structures (structs), with some statically stored and others dynamically (with `malloc`). 
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-10-16 at 3.42.42 p.m..png|300]]
- There's no boolean. 0 is `False`, anything else is `True`. 

### Pointers, Simplified:
I've rewritten this bit a lot, pointers are a tricky topic man. What are they? Pointers are just other *variables that just happen to be the memory address of something else*. Why? We use this to pass variables around without changing their addresses. 

##### Example C code:
```C
int x = 4; // This simply sets a variable x to the value 4. English: ""Integer x is set to 4""
int* pX = &x; // English: ""pX is a pointer to an integer, and it's set to the address of (&) variable x.""
int y = *pX; // English: ""y is a variable set to the value pointed to by pX""
```

The `*` operator can be used in two contexts:
1. For declaring a variable as a pointer that points to a specific data type
2. For *dereferencing*: If something is a pointer, adding a `*` gets you the value pointed to by that pointer. Otherwise, it's just the address there. 


### Arrays in C:
- They're fixed at the size declared at Initialisation. 
- No knowledge of their length. (I.E. no checking if their indexing in bounds)
- Pointers are often used to carry arrays through functions.
- Index is 0 based.
##### Example Arrays:
```c
int m[] = {5, 8, 10}; // size fixed to 3
int n[2][10]; // two-dimensional array
			  //  with 2 rows and 10 cols
point p[4];   // array of 4 structs
```

### Strings in C:
- Strings are just arrays of chars. 
- An extra bit is taken up as Strings end with `\0`. 
	- $\therefore$ `char s1[] = “string, too""; // length=12`
- Assigning strings uses `strcpy(s, ""string!"")`. 

> [!warning] Warning!
> When comparing strings using *==*, you're comparing if their addresses are the same. You likely want to instead compare if their values are the same.

Combinational and Sequential Logic Blocks.md,"Combinational and Sequential Logic Blocks.md

### What:
These are the *building blocks* used in [[Digital Circuits]] to implement [[Logic Functions]]. 

### The Different Types:
##### Combinational Logic Blocks:
- ***Simply***: Basic building blocks that don't have any memory and whose output is a pure function of the present input only. Examples:
	- *[[Logic Gates]]*: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR.
	- *[[Encoders-Decoders]]*: Converting data from one format to another.
	- *Comparators*: Comparing values
- **Quirks**:
	- *Instant output*: The output changes immediately when the inputs changed.
	- *Design:* Typically designed with a [[Truth Table]].
	- 

##### Sequential Logic Blocks:
- ***Formal***: The present output depends on the present input *as well* as past input(s).
- ***Simply***: These blocks have memory and their output is a function of the input as well as the history of past inputs, (the state). Lowkey just a Combinational Logic Block but with a memory bit added. Example:
	- ***Flip-Flops***: These store a single piece of data. Like a light switch (more accurately light button), it will remember the previous state and only change when you give it a new '*flip*' command.
	![[Screenshot 2023-11-13 at 5.23.57 p.m..png|500]]

###### But sir, the timing?
Because it's half a combinational logic block, whenever you change the input, the state changes and thus the output could possibly change. This is known as *asynchronous sequential logic*."
Rolle's Theorem.md,"Rolle's Theorem.md

It's a pretty dumb theorem stating the obvious... As per.

Informally, if a continuous differentiable function starts and ends at the same $y$ over a given range, then there's at least one critical point. 

![[Screenshot 2023-07-30 at 7.48.48 p.m..png]]

> [!note] Rolle's Theorem
> If:
> - Differentiable on a range
> - Starts and ends at the same $y$ (I.E. $f(a)=f(b)$)
> - $\therefore$ There must be a $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$ (I.E. It's a extrema...)

### Further Applications:
With this, we're able to generalise more freely to The [[Mean Value Theorem]]."
Implication (Logic).md,"Implication (Logic).md

### Implication

There’s the bog standard [[Logical Connectives]] you’re already used to; _and_, _or_, _not_ etc. There is a new one to consider: _**Implies**_. The symbol is _**A → B**_ , read as “_A implies B”_

Consider the statement: “_If you study hard, then you will pass the test_”. Studying hard will be **A** and passing the test will be **B**. The truth table _for the statement as a whole_ is to the right.

If **A** is false, then we can’t really deduce anything about the actual statement. The statement tells us nothing about what actually happens if we _don’t_ study. Thus, the statement could still hold True. Therefore, if **A** is ever False, the implicative is True.

Multiple Linear Regression.md,"Multiple Linear Regression.md

### How to evolve from [[Simple Linear Regression]]:
Consider LR with just a single feature. The line is given by $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \text{noise}$. But what if you had more features? If you were to simply add another feature $x^{(2)}$ (with say $0$ and $1$ representing the new feature (or its absence)), you'd be left with: 

$$\begin{align*}
\underbrace{\text{child's height}}_{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \underbrace{\text{parent's height}}_{x^{(1)}} + \beta_2 \underbrace{\text{gender}}_{x^{(2)}} + \text{noise}
\end{align*}$$
##### The Downside?
Look carefully. If gender is 0, it will be the original line. If it's 1, then it will be an offset to the original line. This assumes that the slope will be the same for the feature's presence or absence. 
###### Counter Example:
Imagine building a house price predictor, with features *'Number of Bedrooms'* and *'Far from City Center'*. The slopes would be inverses. 

### Solution:
> $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1}^{(1)} + \beta_2x_{2}^{(2)} + \beta_3x^{(1)}x^{(2)} + \text{noise}$

In this case, $\beta_3$ encodes the difference between the 2 slopes. But guess what? This generalises to where we were to begin with... Lol.

***Note***: The $x^{(1)}x^{(2)}$ is known as interaction terms. The bits that allows that 2 different features have 2 different slopes. 

### General Model for MLR:
> $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1}^{(1)} + \beta_2 x_{2}^{(2)} + \beta_3 x_{3}^{(3)} + \ldots + \text{noise}$

***As vectors:***
$$\begin{align*}
\underbrace{\left[ \begin{array}{c}
y_1 \\
y_2 \\
\vdots \\
y_n
\end{array} \right]}_{y}
&=
\left[ \sum_{j=0}^{p} \beta_j \right]
\underbrace{\left[ \begin{array}{c}
x_{1j} \\
x_{2j} \\
\vdots \\
x_{nj}
\end{array} \right]}_{x^{(j)}}
+
\underbrace{\left[ \begin{array}{c}
e_1 \\
e_2 \\
\vdots \\
e_n
\end{array} \right]}_{e}
\end{align*}
$$

***Note***: $\beta_{j}$ is the effect of $x^{(j)}$ on $y$ if all the other features stay fixed

- ***Input***: A directed graph $G=(V,E)$ and a designated node $s$ (starting node) in $V$. Assume every node $u$ in $V$ is reachable from $s$. We're also given length $l_{e}$ for ever edge $e$ in $E$. (A fully connected graph basically)
- ***Output***: For every node $u$ in $V$, a shortest path from $s \rightarrow u$. (I.E. A list of paths.)

### How it works:
- ***Idea***: Constantly maintain a set $S$ of nodes $u$ for which we've the shortest path from $s$. 
	- $S$ is the explored part insofar.
- **Mathematical Greedy Criteria**: $d'(v) = \min_{e=(u,v), u \in S} \{ d(u) + l_e \}$, where 
	- ***Simple Terms***: At each step / node, the shortest path from $u$ to $v$: Choose the node that's closest to you (minimises *the path to where you are* + *the possible paths around you*). 
	- ***In even simpler terms***: At each step, analyse ever node directly neighbouring your known paths. Jump  to the closest node (***from any known node** in your set of distances*) and update the list of paths you have to include that node. 

### Example:
![[Screenshot 2024-01-20 at 7.04.39 p.m..png]]
- In this iteration, we could jump to either $y$, $x$ (two different ways) or $v$. 
- To minimise distance travelled, we go to either $x$ (through $u$) or $v$. 
- We'd thus add either one to the list of paths. 


### Getting Actual Paths:
As is, we've a list of lengths of paths. To get ***paths***, we simply have to record the edge (the last node) that led us to explore this current node. So you backtrack hopping from node to its respective node that led to it."

### What's it all about?
When talking about [[Language|spoken language]], consider how we differentiate the non-stop sound waves hitting our ears into concrete words? 

### Methods:
- In English, we tend to stress the first syllable - this can give a clue it's a new word. (*hamster* vs *ham stir*)
- In English we have rules about how every word must contain a vowel, finite set of consonant clusters at the beginning of a word, etc. (EG. *gd*og isn't a word) 
- We can also bootstrap from words we already know
- Within words, there's phonemes that occur consistently - we use [[Statistical Regularities in Speech]]."

The Master Theorem.md,"The Master Theorem.md

A straight forward way of analysing the [[Time Complexity]] of [[Divide and Conquer Algorithms]]. 

## The 3 Buckets:
##### Setup:
Given a [[Recurrence Relation]], in the form below, it categorises the time complexity of the relation into 3 time complexities.


**RR**: $$T(n) = aT(\frac{n}{b}) + f(n)$$
***Alternative Form***: $$
T(n) = 
\begin{cases} 
\Theta(1) & \text{if } n \leq n_0 \\
aT\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + \Theta(n^k) & \text{if } n > n_0 
\end{cases}
$$

**Where**:
- $n$ is the size of the problem
- $a \ge 1$ is the number of subproblems
- $b > 1$ is the factor by which the problem is reduced (ie $\frac{n}{b}$ is the size of each subproblem)
- $f(n) = \Theta(n^k)$  is the time cost of dividing the problem and combining the results of the sub-problems
- $aT(\frac{n}{b})$ is the time cost of solving each smaller problem

##### By Latex:
Where $e=log⁡_b(a)$,
$$
T(n) = 
\begin{cases} 
O(n^e) & \text{if } e > k \\
O(n^k \log n) & \text{if } e = k \\
O(n^k) & \text{if } e < k 
\end{cases}
$$

##### Case 1:
- **Formally**: If $f(n)$ is $O(n^{log_{b}{(a−ϵ)}})$ for some $ϵ>0$, then $T(n)=Θ(n^{log⁡_b(a)})$.
- **Informally**: If the cost of dividing and combining takes less time than solving the smaller problems, then the time complexity is dominated by solving the smaller problems. 

##### Case 2:
- **Formally**: If $f(n)$ is $Θ(n^{log⁡_{b}(a)}\times log⁡_{k}(n))$ for a $k≥0$, then $T(n)=Θ(n^{log⁡_{b}(a)}\times \log_⁡{k+1}{(n)})$
- **Informally**: If the cost of dividing (and combining) the problem and the cost of solving the smaller problems is the same time complexity, you multiply the amount of time it takes for one level by the number of levels. 

##### Case 3:
- **Formally**: If $f(n)$ is $Ω(n^{log⁡_{b}{(a+ϵ)}})$ for some $ϵ>0$, and if $af(\frac{n}{b})≤kf(n)$ for some constant $k<1$ and sufficiently large $n$, then $T(n)=Θ(f(n))$
- **Informally**: If the cost of dividing them up is an [[Asymptotic Bounding (Big O)|asymptotic bound above]] solving the subproblems, then the time complexity is that of dividing them up.

> [!info]
> These notes were directly imported from [[Notion]]. They're not in [[Atomic Notes]] style. 

$2x_1 - 3x_2 + 5x_3 = 7$ is a Linear Equation. Multiple would be a SLE. The _Solution_ to this System could not exist, there could be just one solution (ie just one possible value for x1,x2,x3 respectively) or there could be infinitely many.

A system with at least one solution is called consistent, otherwise it’s inconsistent.

Parametric form is just fancy way for saying “in completely different variables”. IE, the parametric form of the original equation could be $2x_1 = 3v +5s$, $v=x_2$ and $s=x_3$.

When there’s only two variables involved (ie $x + y = 2$), the SLE described geometrically. If the system has just one equation, ie the one above, there could be infinitely many solutions. ($1.5 + 5 = 2$, $2+0=2$ ).

If there’s two equations in the system, there’s 3 possibilities:

1.  The 2 equations intersect at a unique point. IE The system has a single solution.
2.  The lines are distinct and parallel. They do not intersect. There’s no solution to this system.
3.  The lines are identical. The system has infinitely many solutions for every point they intersect. (Think: $x+y=2$ and $2x+2y=4$).

When trying to solve SLE’s with more than 3 variables, it’s important to use the Matrix Method. This method is outlined in ILA notebook. It’s not easy."

### Rescaling of Expectation, Variance, and Standard Deviation
When a random variable $X$ is rescaled by a constant $a$, where $Y = aX + b$, the *expectation*, *variance*, and *standard deviation* are affected as follows:
- The expectation becomes $E(Y) = aE(X) + b$
- The variance becomes $\text{Var}(Y) = a^2 \text{Var}(X)$.
- The standard deviation, being the square root of the variance, is scaled by the absolute value of $a:\   \text{SD}(Y) = |a| \text{SD}(X)$."

> [!info] An idea
> When referring to any sort of [[AI]] Models, we must ask ourselves; '*What are models?*': 
> 
> *They're unique abstractions of reality, which we can form any way we choose.* 

### High Level Overview:
As in most of [[AI|ML]], we *do not* want to create hard If-This-Then-That rules. Instead, we want to create a bunch of tuneable knobs and dials (i.e. ***weights***). We then feed it a bunch of examples and (somehow) these weights get turned in just the right way. We can then feed a never-before-seen example into the model, and it will return with a reasonable output. ([[Simple Linear Regression]] is simple example; the knobs are $y$-intercept and the slope.)

### Weights and Biases:
These are a fundamental part of Machine Learning - the knobs and dials. They're often dubbed *""weights""* because (as in [[Multiple Linear Regression]]), you take the weighted sum. They're the thing being trained. This is the same as simple *Matrix Multiplication*, but writing it like this makes life easier for training on GPUs.

- Quantities we *use for prediction* are called: *independent / exploratory variables*, *covariates* or *features*. (Often denoted *x*)
- *Parametric Model*: A model with some free-moving variables that we can *fit* so the model becomes better (E.G. Weights in a [[Neural Networks]]) - Done by optimising a loss function.

> This page needs a revamp. Write it the way you'd teach it.

## What:
Refers to an entire category of [[(Machine Learning) Models|AI models]]. They're loosely inspired by the brain. 


### Categories:
1. **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**: 
   - The simplest type, where information flows in one direction (from input to output).
   - **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)** are a **type of feedforward neural network** with one or more hidden layers.
   - MLPs are fully connected, meaning every node in one layer is connected to every node in the next layer.

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:
   - Specialised for tasks like image recognition and processing.
   - They use convolutional layers that apply filters to detect features (like edges, shapes, and patterns).

3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**:
   - Designed for sequence-based data like time series or language models.
   - RNNs have connections that form directed cycles, enabling them to have ""memory"" of previous inputs.

4. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:
   - These are more advanced forms used for generative tasks (e.g., creating new images, enhancing photos).
   
5. **Transformers**:
   - A more recent and powerful architecture for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision.
   - The Transformer architecture underlies many state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT and BERT)."
Lessons From EdiAI.md,"Lessons From EdiAI.md

## Leading:
- ***Lofty work and autonomy motivates people:*** Remind people that they're a part of something great *(in our case, the AI society of one of the best schools in the world)* and that they can do anything *(Eg: nothing stopping us from getting DeepMind in to give a talk*).  
- ***Work visibly hard:*** This is obvious. The rest of the team should be equally invested, but if someone can't do something (non-technical obviously), the onus should fall on the leader to pick up the slack. They should know they're supported and not alone. *That said*, they should be invested to work through it even when it is hard.
- ***Give people autonomy:*** Give genuinely important (and difficult) tasks to competent people. Give them resources and motivation (through lofty [[Goals|goals]]). Don't just pawn off stuff you don't want to do. Check in frequently, but leave it as theirs. Give them credit every step of the way. 

## Team
- ***Quality of committee > Quantity of committee***. A small team of highly capable and motivated individuals will do ***far*** more work than a large team of half-assed mostly-interested people. 
- ***Corporate vs. Startup exists in Uni:*** Corporate vs Startups represents big, slow moving, lots of talk, established, reputable vs smaller, faster moving, unknown etc.. These are traits found in Uni societies as well. [[EUFS]], as great as it is, is a behemoth. They've no problem recruiting, but often recruit like corporate. Startups have the ability to only take on cracked people. As a result, they can move at breakneck speed. Both have their place in the world (and in [[University of Edinburgh|uni]] as well.)

## Organisational Stuff:
- ***Upfront Time Commitment > Aggregated Time Commitment:*** *Students prefer to give up a full Saturday and/or Sunday (combined ~24-48 hours) over 4 hours a week over 8 weeks*. Wasn't intuitive to me, the data proved otherwise. Thus easier to get people to work on a hackathon project over a longer-term project. 
- ***When hiring, send rejection letters promptly:*** Hiring is hard, cos you have to reject people who are great but not quite a fit for you. Be clear, honest and concise in your rejection. 

## Expo:
- Less lanyards
- Judge in before the public shows up. Deliberate when the public arrives. Announce winner before public leaves. 
- Make a good rubric. Don't doubly weight anything - even if you think it's important. People learn to play into that. 
- Having more knowledgeable judges is a lifesaver so they can grill contestants. 
- Having more authoritative (eg person from industry, lecturer etc.) is also a lifesaver - people value their opinion more (even without basis)

World's Readiness for SAE Level 4.md,"World's Readiness for SAE Level 4.md

## Explanation
A presentation analysing how ready 2 different countries in the world are for SAE Level 4. You chose Japan and Matt chose India(?)

## Speech Draft:
### Title Slide / Japan / 1:

- We will now critically evaluate different countries’ preparedness for SAE Level 4, starting with Japan
- Before asking ourselves how ready Japan is for Level 4, first consider their society makeup that puts them in a unique position. Japan, has the worlds oldest population. Left unchecked, by 2035 over a third of the population will be over 65 years old.

### Slide 2:

- With a future of less people able to drive and more people needing driven, the Japanese government recgonises a mobility crisis. And so they’re stepping in and spearheading a society ripe for AV’s.

### Slide 3-5:

- Quickly run through the legislation they’ve previously enacted.

### Slide 6:

- Fortunately for the Japanese Government, they sit atop technological and road infrastructure that can support their ambitious goals.
- Ranked as having some of the best roads in the world, Japan has spent decades developing the infrastucture that will be useful today.
- The infrastracture for the technology to be tested is already in development. Zones where SAE4 Testing is legal and allowed are being developed, with an expected 40 by 2025, 2 years away.
- There’s also a huge amount of automotive expertise. Japan’s home to Toyota, Honda and Nissan, with Honda actively testing its mapping and ajself driving tech.

### Slide 7:

- The final peice of the puzzle is determining how receptive the general public are with AV’s.
- An astounding 92% of Japanese are positive or neutral towards self driving cars.
- The benefits are also clearly well understood. 80% beleive that a reduction in car incidents is likely.
- However the story is not positive. 85% of Japanese are at least somewhat concerned with riding in an SAE Level 4 car.

### Slide 8:

- So is Japan ready? Well it’s clear that the government is trying to make it so. There’s supportive legislation and fantastic infrastructure. A supportive population that stands to gain a lot with the success of AV’s definitely helps.
- So Japan seems well on the way and is ready for SAE4, but what about a country with a more difficult path ahead? Well I’ll pass you onto Matt who can talk about… I’ve no idea

	 - 5th best according to [source](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/roads_quality/)
- Stats for Powerpoint on Japan ([source](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/109433/103139.pdf))
- It has a history of being progressive with AV. In 2016, they enabled free testing of AV’s on public Japanese Roads, without the need for permits or anything ([source](https://www.npa.go.jp/english/bureau/traffic/summary-guideline-en.pdf), [source](https://www.npa.go.jp/english/bureau/traffic/guideline.pdf)).

- In April of 2022, the Japanese Gov’t ok’d use of SAE Level 4 vehicles on (sparsely populated?) public roads ([Sources](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=7482b70a-1ade-43da-b9ed-f518ca8ba278), [Source](https://www.nippon.com/en/news/yjj2022030400318/)), the law will pass in April 2023. By 2025, there will be 40 “areas” (prefectures?) with these “mobility services”, and 100 by 2030. (Per Japanese Gov’t, [source](https://www.nippon.com/en/news/yjj2022030400318/)). - “Additionally, the ministry of economy, trade, and industry (METI) has plans for 40 autonomous taxi test sites nationwide by 2025.” ([source](https://techwireasia.com/2021/09/japans-betting-on-autonomous-cars-for-a-unique-reason/))
    - Curiously, this legislation also paves the way for Automated delivery robots on sidewalks.
- It currently has vehicles operating at SAE 4 on its public roads. In the town of Eiheiji, a  autonomous minibus transports tourists and the elderly alone it’s sparsely populated roads ([source](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/01/31/national/driverless-vehicles-fukui/)). They’re only able to do this thanks to the public research organisation AIST covering the costs and collaborating on research ([source](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/01/31/national/driverless-vehicles-fukui/)).
- The Government has laid out an official roadmap for where it wants to go ([source](https://www.npa.go.jp/english/bureau/traffic/target.pdf)).
- Home to many of the world’s leading automotive companys, for example; Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Misubushi to name a few. These companies actively perform research here to see the growing validity of the field. For example, Honda is currently testing out it’s self-driving car and mapping technology. ([source](https://aibusiness.com/verticals/honda-and-cruise-to-test-autonomous-vehicles-in-japan))
- Japan has an vibrant entrepreneurial spirit, looking to take advantage of and utlise the lax laws."

Attention (AI).md,"Attention (AI).md

## Goal Of Attention:
Words have different meaning depending on the context (i.e. *""Make a bank deposit""* vs. *""The river bank""*). But with traditional [[Vector Embeddings]] (and after the first step of an [[Large Language Models (LLMs)|LLM]]), the *""bank""* embedding will be identical. 

Ideally, an *""Attention Block""* will change (i.e. add/subtract to) those individual word vectors, so they (the vectors signifying the meaning of a word) move to a more accurate position (i.e. a position more reflective of its actual meaning). 

##### Example: 
Take the *""monster""* vector. It's not very descriptive of anything in particular (other than an abstract, scary large and looming figure). Now take the sentence: *""The green, 1-eyed creature is the star of the Disney Pixar movie. He's short, has small horns and a non-confrontational figure. He's not a very menacing **monster**.""*. Ideally, the second instance of *""monster""* is incredibly close to the vector for *""Mike Wazowski""*.

Exactly how did we update the word's vector? Well that's what the Attention Mechanism does.

## How Do We Actually Do It?

### 1. What Words Relevant?
We need to find out what words are important relative to other words. That is to say, when looking at 1 word, what word (that is previously before it) should we pay attention to?
#### 1.1. Queries:
- ***Motivation:*** We want words to attend to only a specific selection of others in a sentence. Query vectors help us find out what to pay attention to.
- ***How Should They Work?:*** The query vector should be a vector that (somehow) encodes a question (or query 😉). For example, the word *monster* from above may have a query asking *""What adjectives are describing me?""*
- ***How Do We Get Query Vectors?:*** We'll call the query vector of the $n$*-th* word $\vec{Q_n}$. To find it, we multiply the word embedding, ($\vec{E_n}$), by a learned matrix $W_Q$. 
- ***Intuition:*** The query vector is the *""search""* query.

#### 1.2. Keys:
- ***Intuition:*** (Ideally) *These vectors (somehow) describe themselves*. For example, *""I describe the **monster** in question.""*
- ***How They're Learned:*** They're made the exact same way as $\vec{Q_n}$, but this time represented as $\vec{K_n}$. 

#### 1.3. `Query:Key` Matrix:
By getting the dot product of every *Query Vector* with every other *Key Vector*, we can see how much each word ***""attends to""*** every other word. We then apply [[Softmax Function|softmax]], column by column. In the below example, *""fluffy""* and *""blue""* attends to *""creature""*, and *""verdant""* attends to *""forest""*. *(Size of the dot represents positive magnitude of softmax'ed dot product)*. 

![[Pasted image 20250102174844.png|500]]. 

***Note:** To prevent later tokens influencing earlier ones, we set the values (pre-softmax) to the bottom left triangle to $-\infty$, so the resulting softmax. This is known as ""Masking""*

***Note 2:** The size of the attention pattern is what's commonly referred to as the context window. That's why it **was** hard to just keep increasing the context window (with the original transformer architecture)*.


### 2. Updating Values
Great! We've found out how every word is relevant to every other word. Now, we need to work on updating those words' embeddings (as we gave in the original Mike Wazowski example).

#### 2.1. Value Matrix:
 1. Let's say we want to update the vector for *""monster""* .
 2. We make another learnable Matrix, $W_V$. 
 3. We multiply this by every word's embedding ($\vec{E_n}$) to create $\vec{V_n}$. 
 4. Multiply $\vec{V_n}$ by the amount we need to attend to it by (i.e. by the size of dot product).
 5. Add the column up. The change ($\Delta\vec{E_n}$) is the amount the word's vector must change to represent it. 
 6. Then add the change ($\Delta\vec{E_n}$) to the actual word's embedding ($\vec{E_n}$). Your new vector should be more contextually rich. 

![[Pasted image 20250103134705.png]]

*All of this combined is a **single head** of attention.*

### 3. Putting It All Together:
We actually run a bunch of heads of attention in parallel *(so multiple of the above images in parallel)*. They all just learn different $W_V$, $W_K$, $W_Q$. 
- Each attention head proposes a change for a specific word's embedding, so we add all of THOSE proposed changes to a word's embedding. That's just the updated word embedding for a single word. You've gotta do that for every word. No wonder these things use a lot of electricity."
Statement (Proposition).md,"Statement (Proposition).md

### How to Write:
$\forall x \in D$, $P(x) \implies Q(x)$

A proposition or statement is a a sentence that declares thats *either* true or false. 

$\neg p$ or ~$p$ are both negative the statement. 

This is seen in a [[Truth Table]]."
SSL - TLS.md,"SSL - TLS.md

## Objective & Background:
- Point-to-point secure channel. No-one in between can read the message contents. (Also ofc we're maintaining the [[Computer Security|computer security standards]]). (***Confidentiality***)
- It should detect corruption of communication. (***Integration***)
- The server ***must*** prove itself to the client. The ***client*** may prove itself to the server. (***Authentication***)
 
### Setup:
- Assume an adversary has full control of the network, it can redirect all traffic, it can read all data, it can be a man in the middle.   
- Assuming that, TLS should still work. 

### How though...
1. 🟦: The traditional [[TCP Vs UDP|TCP Handshake]] (at which point the [[Asymmetric Encryption|asymmetrically encrypted]] connection is established).
2. 🟩: The client says hello, and lists the encryption standards it supports. 
3. 🟩: The server responds to use the strongest encryption standard. 
4. 🟩: The server sends its [[Certificate Authority|certificate]] 
5. 🟩: The server sends confirmation.
6. 🟦: The client encrypts a [[Symmetric Encryption|session key]] with the server's public key and sends it.
7. 🟦: The next 4 blues depend on the specific encryption method used. ([[RSA Algorithm]] is basic key exchange.)
8. ◻️: They then use the session key to communicate with each other 😎. 
![[Pasted image 20241027130732.png|600]]

## The Attacks:
- **LOGJAM 🪵**: What if the someone hopped in the middle and immediately only offered super weak encryption methods. (They didn't change anything though). Then the encryption could be broken with brute force.
- **Bleichenbacher (B98) 🃏**: In a specific RSA, there was padding. If you sent a message with incorrect padding, the recipient would respond differently, based on how messed up the padding was. So, if Eve snooped in between Alice and Bob, copied the message but changed it slightly and sent it to Alice, Eve would get different responses. If Eve did this about a million times, with different messages every time, Eve could eventually recreate the message."

Zero Knowledge.md,"Zero Knowledge.md

> [!note] Guess what...
> I was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c) video and they randomly spoke about [[NP Completeness]]...

## What?
Imagine you go to the pub. You (the prover), need to show your I.D. (witness - I know, stupid name) to get served. You show the bartender (the verifier) your I.D. to prove you're over 18. Problem is they learn your birthday, address, etc.. Is there a way to share nothing about yourself, but also a verifier can concretely know for sure you're definitely over 18? In other words:

### Criteria for Zero Knowledge:
1. (Malicious) Prover must definitely know the witness. (I.E. you must provably be over 18, even if the verifier doesn't see it.) (**Proof of Knowledge**)
2. (Malicious) Verifier learns nothing about about the witness. (**Zero Knowledge**)
3. The boring clause: Assuming everyone acts honestly, the system works as intended.


### How?
We sorta tackle criteria 1 and 2 separately. 
1. We interrogate the son of a bitch a crap ton (all questions about the witness). If the prover answers all (read: thousands) of questions successfully, then it worked. 
	1. For example, let's say the witness is how to get from the word SILENT to LISTEN.
	2. We ask the prover how to get from SILENT to TELISN **OR** how to get from TELISN to LISTEN.
	3. If you're able to do that, you must know how to get from SILENT to LISTEN
2. We, as the prover, simulate everything the verifier could ask us. If we simulate it, and it's the same as a real conversation, then we must not have given any information up."

Linked Lists.md,"Linked Lists.md

### What are they?
They are [[Data Structures]] - [[Lists]] specifically - where objects are arranged in Linear Order. A linked list comes in *nodes*. These are tuples of data. The first bit is the value and the second is where the next bit of data is stored in [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually]] (I.E. it's address.)

### Doubly Linked List:
Same idea, but it refers to the next address, the current value and the previous address.
![[Screenshot 2023-10-13 at 8.12.08 p.m..png|500]]

### Time Complexity:
- `.get()` and `.set()` Because you have to iterate over each item individually to find a given item, time complexity is $\Theta(n)$
- `.cons()` -> $\Theta(1)$ *always*
- `.insert(i, x)` and `.delete(i)` have $\Theta(n)$ worst case. But if you already know the address of `i-1`, then it would be $\Theta(1)$."
Variance and Standard Deviation.md,"Variance and Standard Deviation.md

Similar the ***Standard Deviation***. 

### Variance:
It measures the *spread* of observations with respect to the mean. IE Calculates the average of the squared differences from the mean. 
##### How could you calculate it?
- Find the mean
- Calculate the difference between each item and the mean
- Square the differences
- Get the average of the squared differences
- ${\sigma}^{2} = E[X-{\mu}^{2}]$
##### What about for the sample variance:
- When finding the mean, divide by $n-1$ and not $n$, as this will help 
- Why?
	- Remember the sample variance is often too small when compared than the population bias

### Standard Deviation:
The square root of the variance and provides a measure of the spread of the distribution in the same *units of data*. Gives a sense of the *average distance from the mean*.  

##### Calculate it:
$\sigma =\sqrt{{\sigma}{^2}}$

### Covariance Vs Variance:
- ***Variance:*** The measure of how much the values in the dataset differ from the mean of the data (Are the arrows spread out or tightly packed around the bullseye?)
	- $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2$
- ***Covariance:*** The measure of how correlated two variables, X and Y, are. (E.G. Collecting the data to see that taller people are heavier - positive covariance). 
	- $\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})$"
Masking in Binary.md,"Masking in Binary.md

### Concept:

2. Your Mask: `0x0000000F` (In binary: `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1111`)
3. Apply Mask: Perform a bitwise AND between the address and the mask.

Equivalence Relations & Classes.md,"Equivalence Relations & Classes.md

Heavily interconnected with the idea of [[Relations]]:
### What's it all about? Eq Relations first:
If you want to say *""Set $Q$ is an equivalence relation to Set $S$""*, it needs to satisfy 3 properties for all $a$, $b$, $c$ in $S$. 
1. **Reflexivity:** $a$ is related to itself, I.E. $a \equiv a$
2. **Symmetry:** If $a \equiv b$ then $b \equiv a$
3. **Transitivity:** If $a \equiv b$ and $b \equiv c$, then $a \equiv c$
	1. Note: There's the idea of Transitive Closure of a Relation. If you have a set that only has (a, b) and (b, c), then the transitive closure is the set with all of those previous sets as well as indirect routes, like (a, c).

### And Relations Classes?:
The idea of splitting different relations into different buckets (classes). Each bucket contains things considered the same by that rule. 
##### Quick Example:
If your equivalence relation is $aRb$, where $R$ is $3|(m-n)$, then a suitable class would be where all remainders are 1. I.E. $[a] = \{x \in \mathbb{Z}\ |\ x=3k + 1\ for\ some\ k \in \mathbb{Z}\ \}$

### Equivalent Relations and Classes
When the relation is all ***reflexive***, ***symmetric*** and ***transitive***. A class is splitting different relations into different buckets, containing things considered the same by that rule. E.G If your equivalence relation is $aRb$ where $R$ is $3|(m-n)$, then a suitable class would be where all remainders are 1. I.E. $[a] = \{x \in \mathbb{Z}\ |\ x=3k + 1\ for\ some\ k \in \mathbb{Z}\ \}$"
3 Dining Cryptographers.md,"3 Dining Cryptographers.md

## Imagine:
3 [[Cryptography|cryptographers]] are having dinner. At the end of the dinner, they're informed that the dinner has been paid for. Either the NSA paid or one of them did. They want to find out which, **without** revealing the identify of a (potentially) paying cryptographer.

### Process
1. Every possible [[Combinations|pair]] of cryptographer flips a coin, such that only those 2 see the result. ($\text{heads} = 1$, $\text{tails} =0$)
2. *Each participants announces* the [[Logical Connectives|XOR]] of *everything* they saw.
	1. If someone paid, then they instead announce the ***opposite*** of the **XOR** of everything they saw (i.e. the negation).
3. We then **XOR** the three announcements:
	1. If the NSA paid, the result should be: $0$
	2. If someone paid, the result would be: $1$

### Couple of Problems:
- ***Really impractical:*** - the number of flips required grows quadratically
- ***Fragile:*** If someone doesn't do the protocol, it breaks immediately.

IO.md,"IO.md

> [!warning] Remember!
> I/O is slow! (compared to a [[CPU - Processor Components|CPU]])

### How does it work?
You get a I/O (Custom) Controller that speaks directly to the device. Take below. All of the devices are connected via a different means (which all have different standards). Thus, we need custom controller to manage all of them with different standards themselves. The [[IO Interface|I/O Interface]] would be the [[RS232]] for example.

![[Screenshot 2023-11-25 at 12.52.40 p.m..png|300]]

### How would you connect I/O Controllers to CPU?: Buses
- A bus is an interface (literally a bundle of wires) that connects the CPU to something else. 
- A portion of [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually|memory]] is reserved for I/O devices. This is [[Memory Mapped IO]]. The problem with this? Well I/O is super slow. 
	- Solution? We're making a *Bus Adapter*. It's a physical thing. It's an interface in-between the IO
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-11-28 at 3.39.29 p.m..png|300]]

### How do we check the I/O Status? (E.G. Key Clicked?):
- **Polling**: Query the OS regularly. It's pretty wasteful for events that happen infrequently
- **Interrupt**: I/O controller interrupts user process to signal an I/O event. (Very heavy) -> But better as it happens less frequently."
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).md,"ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).md

## Background: 
Basically, all computers who want to [[TCP-IP|communicate]] with another in the same subnet, need both their [[IP Address]] and their [[Mac Address]]. Why, you may be asking? Because MAC Address is needed to communicate to the other devices on a hardware level, and the IP is needed to communicate on the internet layer. 

## So ARP?
It's the protocol that maps IP Addresses to MAC Addresses. It's pretty shit ngl. It works by:
- `Computer A` will check it's ARP [[Cache]], to see if it already has a the mapping. 
- If not, `Computer A` will broadcast on the network screaming *""Oi! Who's at MAC is at 192.168.1.73??""*
- `Computer C` will then respond with *""Yeh `A` it's me! Here it is...""*
- *Note: `Computer X` could just tell `Computer A`  that any arbitrary IP address is at any arbitrary mac address, even if `A` didn't ask. `A` will change her ARP Cache regardless. Explained below:*

## Security Vulnerability
Butttttt... ARP is blindly faithful. 
- It doesn't keep track on whether a machine has recently ***even asked*** for a new IP address.
- *If someone tells you about a new IP, you will change the table entry, regardless of how recently that was last changed.*

### Man In The Middle / ARP Poisoning / ARP Spoofing
The good ol' Man In The Middle attack is used here, with an eavesdropper telling both about new ARP entries. 
![[Pasted image 20240923170953.png|600]]

QuickSort.md,"QuickSort.md

### What?
A type of [[Sorting Algorithms]]. When you hear it, think ***Pivot***. Criteria of a pivot:
- All items to the left are smaller 
- Items to the right are bigger

### How does it work?
1. Choose a ***Pivot*** and move it to the end
2. Set `Pointer Red` ($p_r$) and `Pointer b` ($p_b$) to the first element in the given array.
3. If $p_r$ $\le$ ***Pivot***: Swap items pointed to by both $p_r$ and $p_b$.
	- If so, increment $p_b$
4. Increment $p_r$.
5. Stop when $p_r$ is sent out of bounds. 
6. Recursively repeat this for each sides of the pivot. 

### [[Loop Invariant]] For QuickSort:
- Everything $\lt \ p_b$ is $\le$ ***Pivot***
- Everything $\ge p_{b}$ and $\lt p_r$ is $\gt$ ***Pivot***
 
### How do we choose the Pivot?
##### *Popular Option*: Meeting of Three:
Sort the first, middle and last indexes. Choose the middle as the pivot. This makes the assumption that the middle of these items is the median of the array. 

### Time Complexity:
- ***Worst Case***: $O(n^2)$
- ***Average Case***: $O(n\lg n)$"

	- Dashboard Display: Shows the user relevant information such as vehicle status, route planning, and traffic conditions.
	- Voice Assistant: Allows hands-free control and interaction with the vehicle systems.
2. Middleware Layer
	- API Gateway: Handles communication between the User Interface Layer and the various subsystems in the stack.
	- Data Storage: Manages storage and retrieval of data generated during vehicle operation, such as maps, sensor data, and user preferences.3. Decision Making Layer
3. [[Perception]] & Localisation Layer
	- Sensor Fusion: Combines data from multiple sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors to create a comprehensive view of the vehicle's surroundings.
	- Object Detection and Tracking: Identifies and tracks objects, including other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and obstacles in the vehicle's path.
	-   *Localisation*: Estimates the vehicle's position and orientation within the environment using sensor data and map information.
4. Decision Making
	- Path Planning: Determines the best route to reach the destination using map data and real-time traffic information.
	-   Control Algorithms: Calculates acceleration, braking, and steering commands based on path planning, sensor inputs, and vehicle dynamics.
5. Actuation Layer
	- Vehicle Control Interface: Translates the control commands from the Decision Making Layer into signals for the vehicle's actuators.
	- Vehicle Actuators: Controls the vehicle's throttle, brakes, and steering systems to execute the desired maneuvers."
Relations.md,"Relations.md

With relation to [[Set Theory]]: It basically says that a number in set A ($a$) can be related to a number in set B ($b$) by a given relation. This is written as $aRb$, or $R\in(A\times B)$.

They can be the following:
- One-to-one
- Many-to-one
- One-to-many
- Many-to-Many

They're mathematically (sorta?) synonymous with the idea of [[Functions]]. It's the mapping of a given input item to a given output item. 

> [!danger] Note!
> This is not ***exactly*** synonymous with functions. Relations can also include stuff like comparisons. They're functions with less strict qualifiers. Check them in the [[Functions]]

### Different Types of Relations:
- [[Equivalence Relations & Classes]]"
Proof by Induction.md,"Proof by Induction.md

Another type of [[Proofs]]. 

> [!tip] Define:
> If you can show a property holds true for P(0), P(k) and P(k+1), then P(x) holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$

### How do you do it?
**Step 1**: Show that the base step is true (P(a)). 
**Step 2**: We need to show that for every integer $k≥a$, if $P(k)$ is true then so it $P(k+1)$. How do we do this? 
	Assume that $P(k)$ is True, where $k$ is any specific but arbitrary integer with $k≥a$. Then, show that $P(k+1)$ is True. 

## Examples:
There's loads. Here's some covered in lectures:
#### For which positive integers $n$ do we have $2^n > 4n$?
$P(N) = 2^n > 4n$
Prove:  P(n) holds for all n>= 5

**Base case**: $2^5 > 4(5)$
**Induction steps**:
Assume P(k) for some $k$ $(\geq5)$
Using this, we will show P(k+1)

$P(k+1)$ says $2^{k+1} > 4(k+1)$
We may use $2^k > 4k$

$2^{k+1} = 2 * 2^{k} > 2 * 4k$ -> Induction hypothesis

$= 4k +4k \geq 4k+4$

So we have shown that P(k) implies P(k+1)
And we have shown that P(5)

So, by PMI (Principal of Mathematical Induction), P(n) holds for all n>=5 which had to be shown. 

### Graph:
Statement: Given a [[Graphs]] with n nodes, without cycles, the number of edges < n, assuming there's at least 1 node
P(n): I will show P(n) by induction
Base Case: P(1). Even a single edge leads to a cycle. So there can be no edges. P(1) is true

2nd Steps: Suppose P(k) holds. We need to show P(k+1). Write a graph with k nodes without cycles. There must be a node with exactly 1 outgoing edge.

Let G' be the graph obtained by delating that node and that 1 edge. G' also does not have cycles. G' has k nodes. 

\therefore G had < k+1 edges."
Proof by Contraposition.md,"Proof by Contraposition.md

This is a type of [[Proofs]] that comes from [[Implication (Logic)]]. You can also see the rules of [[Contraposition]]

If you have a statement that is $A \implies B$, but it's hard to prove, try to contrapose it. 
$\therefore$ $\neg B \implies \neg A$"
MultiProgramming.md,"MultiProgramming.md

When talking about [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually]], it's the ability to have multiple programs running at a time. They're not aware of other processes, they can't corrupt / read OS correctly, they don't waste memory.

This is achieved thanks to the [[Address Space]]."
Pages (Virtual Memory).md,"Pages (Virtual Memory).md

### What?
In the same way [[Cache]] is split into Cache Lines, [[Virtual Memory]] is split into ***Pages***. I.E. fixes sized blocks of memory.  
- Frames in Physical memory == Pages in VM. 
### Normally:
- Typical Page sizes are $4$-$16KB$ ($MB$ or $GB$ in Servers) ($2^{12}$ - $2^{14}$).
 - The virtual address comprises of the virtual page number and the byte within. 
- The physical address address is the physical page and offset. The offset is the same as the VA's.

## What?
- Teach a computer to perform tasks without explicitly programming all the rules.
	- Sometimes, we're trying to teach the computer even though we [[Algorithm Distillation|know all of the rules]].
- Works by finding patterns in data (***Generalisation***).
- ***Core objective***: Minimise error on unseen data.
- Encompasses [[Supervised Learning]], [[Unsupervised Learning]], [[Reinforcement Learning]].

### Core Concepts:
1. **Training Data**: A dataset of inputs (features) and outputs (labels or structure). 
   - Assumes the data is representative of the problem space. 
   - Data quality directly impacts performance (***Garbage In, Garbage Out***). 
2. **Model**: A mathematical [[Neural Networks as Function Finders|function]] mapping inputs to outputs (e.g., [[Linear Regression|Linear]] or [[Neural Networks]]).
   - **Hypothesis Space**: All possible functions the model can explore. Relates to [[Computability]]
3. **Learning Algorithm**: Finds the best function by iteratively minimising a loss function. Typically [[Backpropagation]]
4. **Loss Function**: Quantifies how far the model’s predictions are from the truth.
   - Examples: [[Estimators|MSE]] (for regression), [[Cross-Entropy Loss]] (for classification).
5. **Evaluation**: Use metrics (e.g., [[Accuracy vs Precision vs Recall vs F1]]) on a hold-out dataset to test generalisation.

### Types of Machine Learning:
1. [[Supervised Learning]]
2. [[Unsupervised Learning]]
3. [[Reinforcement Learning]]

---

### How It Works:
1. Prepare a dataset (cleaning, normalising, splitting into [[Train-Test Split]]).
2. Choose a model based on the task (e.g., [[Decision Trees]], [[Support Vector Machines]]).
3. Train the model: Minimise the loss function using an optimisation method like [[Gradient Descent]].
4. Evaluate and tune (e.g., [[Hyperparameter Optimisation]]).
5. Deploy the trained model for predictions. 

---

### Challenges:
- **Bias and Variance Trade-off**: Models too simple (high bias) vs too complex (high variance).
- **Overfitting**: Performs well on training data but poorly on new data. (Solution: [[Regularisation]], early stopping, or more data.)
- **Underfitting**: Model fails to capture patterns in data. 

### Security Concerns:
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Small, deliberate changes to input can mislead a model (e.g., fooling an image classifier).
- **Data Poisoning**: Injecting corrupted data during training to bias the model.
- **Privacy**: Sensitive data in training might be reverse-engineered.

## *""How Do I Learn AI?""*:

> [!caution] Hol' Up
> This is by no means the most efficient way of learning ML. It's adjacent to how I learned it. Ruthlessly [[Learning|ask questions]] and follow every rabbit whole you encounter.

1. Dive into the world first. 
	1. Watch / Read:
		1. [AI 2041](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/445514/ai-2041-by-qiufan-kai-fu-lee-and-chen/9780753559024)
		2. [Machine of Loving Grace](https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace)
		3. [Leopold Aschenbrenner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbVtZIn9IM) on Dwarkesh Patel
	3. Follow:
		1. [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com), 
		2. [AI Explained](https://www.youtube.com/@aiexplained-official), 
		3. [[Andrej Karpathy|Andrej]] [Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy), 
		4. [Noam Brown](https://x.com/polynoamial)
	4. There's so many more to even list.
3. Learn how to code with Pandas. If you don't know how:
	1. ***Do not use [[ChatGPT in Education|ChatGPT]] for the following.***
	2. Spin up a Google CoLab for Python. 
	3. Watch this entire [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw?si=-FbeXP0X9NdubI6W) in full. Watch it in 2x. 
		1. Build something you want to build as you watch the video. (EG. Terminal based calculator, a dummy authentication service (bonus points if you learn about and implement [[Cryptographic Hash Functions|hashing]], etc.). The point here is creativity and building something you really want to build). 
4. Watch the following:
	1. [3Blue1Brown DeepLearning Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
	2. Watch and Do Andrej Karpathy's tutorials / videos ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY), [here](https://youtu.be/zduSFxRajkE?si=P8X9-ClP4bT3ni5z))
5. Pick something you're interested in the [[AI]] (Eg [[Computer Vision]], [[Language]], etc.)
	1. Take vision for example. 
	2. Decide to be able to detect if your face, live on your webcam, is happy, or sad or whatever. 
	3. Look online for blogs of people doing this and showing how they did it. 
6. Do [[EdinburghAI|EdinburghAI's]] workshops (available [here](https://github.com/EdinburghAI/workshops)). Instructions are available on the ReadMe. For the theory, watch YouTube videos (we've unfortunately not made the videos live lol). 
7. Pick a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). 
	3. Ask a question about the data and try to answer it programmatically. EG:
		1. Given a dataset on English movie reviews and whether they were positive or negative, could you come up with a model that takes a review and says if it's positive or negative?
		2. Given a dataset of different countries, their GDP, average years schooling, average BMI etc, make a bunch of graphs that compares 2 different criteria. Eg. Average BMI vs Life Expectancy
			1. As an additional step, could you come up with a model that given an average BMI (and all of the other factors), you predict their life expectancy.
8. If you've just done everything here, you've simply dipped your toes in. Every step you take, ask ""*why?*"" until you're stopped by the laws of physics. Follow every question you have. Commit to [[Personal Projects|building]] something before you even know how to build it.

Convergence of Power Series.md,"Convergence of Power Series.md

### Theorem
Consider the power series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_n(x-a)^n$. The series satisfies exactly one of the following properties:

i. The series converges at $x = a$ and diverges for all $x \neq a$.
ii. The series converges for all real numbers $x$.
iii. There exists a real number $R > 0$ such that the series converges if $|x - a| < R$ and diverges if $|x - a| > R$. At the values $x$ where $|x - a| = R$, the series may converge or diverge."
REST API Vs GraphQL.md,"REST API Vs GraphQL.md

## What?
Different paradigms of [[API Design|APIs]]. Remember their best practises! They're technically [[Web Services]]. They're both examples of [[Statelessness]] principals

### REST
- **Resource Based**: Built on the idea of *resources*, with each resource pertaining a *unique URL* (i.e. multiple endpoints).
	- `GET /users/123` to get user details, 
	- `GET /users/123/orders` to get that user's orders. 
- **Built with HTTP Methods**: It's built on CRUD Operations (*create, read, update and delete*).
	- **GET**: Retrieve data (e.g., `GET /users`).
	- **DELETE**: Remove data (e.g., `DELETE /users/123`).
	- **POST**: It's idempotent??? Tf. 
- Tends to over/under fetch.


### GraphQL
- A **Query Based** API, with a *single endpoint* (`/graphql`). Users request exactly what they want. Built by Facebook with Social Medias involved.
- **No Versions**: Devs just add types / fields. 
- **Error Handling**: GraphQL will *always return 200*. Any error found will be found within the response (As discovered at JPMC).
- Can be heavy for server when fetching complex queries.
- Example Request:
```graphql
{
  user(id: 123) {
    name
    email
    orders {
      id
      total
    }
  }
}
```"
Inverse Functions.md,"Inverse Functions.md

> [!note] What are they?
> They * **reverse the operations** done by a function*. When plotted, it's the mirror of a function across the $x=y$ line. Not all functions are invertible, only one's that pass the [[(Calculus)Tests|horizontal line test]] (I.E. One-To-One). It turns $f(x)=y$ to $f^{-1}(y)=x$. 

### To Find:
To get the inverse, replace the function's x's with y's and then solve for y instead. Alternatively, if you're given a value that the $f(x)$ equals, say 22, just think really hard about about function $f'(x)$ satisfies that."
Softmax Function.md,"Softmax Function.md

## What:
A function that takes a bunch of numbers and returns them so they all add up to $1$, with each assigned a [[Probability]] ~relative to the size of it in the beginning.

***The Formula:***
$$\sigma(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{x_j}}$$


#### Temperature (For Use in [[Large Language Models (LLMs)]])
By dividing the exponents by $T$, it affects how we choose the words."
Passkeys.md,"Passkeys.md

## What?
They're modern, more secure alternatives to [[Password Authentication|passwords]]. They use [[Asymmetric Encryption|public-key cryptography]].

### How?
1. When signing up to the website, a [[Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)|public-private key pair]] is generated. The private is stored securely on user's hardware.
2. When logging in, server sends a challenge (just a large random number) to the user.
3. The user [[Digital Signature|signs the challenge]] with their private key.
4. If the server can decrypt it with the public key, the user must own the private key (akin to [[Zero Knowledge|proof of knowledge]]).

#### Benefits:
This brings a slew of benefits:
- Can't be phished
- Resistant to replay attacks and eavesdroppers.

> [!question] Why did this take so long?
> You may be thinking, *""Ok Leo, but asymmetric encryption has been around for a long time. Why is this only now popping off?""*. Couple of reasons:

### What is it?:
Stands for *Autonomous Driving System*. This is mainly a [[coding]] challenge. We take a car IMECHE (the organising body gives us) and develop [[Algorithms]] to make it drive *itself* around a track. Soon (soon as at 04/2023), we aim to develop our own car that can take a driver as well as drive autonomously.   ^9d1d5b

Comparison Theorem.md,"Comparison Theorem.md

### What

Suppose  $f$ and $g$ are continuous with $f(x) \geq g(x) \geq 0$ for all $x \geq a$. Then,

- If $\int_a^{\infty} f(x) \, dx$ converges, then $\int_a^{\infty} g(x) \, dx$ converges (is convergent).
- If $\int_a^{\infty} g(x) \, dx$ diverges, then $\int_a^{\infty} f(x) \, dx$ diverges (is divergent).

Similar statements hold for $\int_{-\infty}^a f(x) \, dx$, and so on, as well as for improper integrals of type 2.

The Comparison Theorem is useful for examples where we only want to know if $\int_a^{\infty} f(x) \, dx$ converges, since perhaps we cannot find the antiderivative of $f$.

### Tip:
Think of similar integrals we know (1/x etc.) and try to compare it relative to that one. 

### Similar for the Limit Comparison Test of [[Series]]

Let $a_n, b_n \geq 0$ for all $n \geq 1$.
1. If $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = L \neq 0$, then $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ and $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n$ both converge or both diverge.
2. If $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = 0$, and $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n$ converges, then $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ converges.
3. If $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = \infty$, and $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n$ diverges, then $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ diverges."
Single- vs Multi-Cycle Processors.md,"Single- vs Multi-Cycle Processors.md

### The Difference, Simply:
##### Single-Cycle Processors, recapped:
Every instruction in a single-cycle [[CPU - Processor Components|processors]] is intended to run on a single clock cycle. The problem is some instructions run through a lot more [[Logic Gates|gates]] than others. Thus, the cycle speed must be as slow as the slowest instruction (*bad*). They're incredibly (relatively speaking) simple however. 

##### Multi-Cycle Processors on the other hand:
Instructions on this type of processor can take multiple clock cycles.  This way instructions will never take more time than necessary. MCP's only use a single ALU, before there were 2 (one for actual adding and another for updating PC).

> [!info] Quirk of MCP
> You're reading 2 registers (A and B in diagram) even if you don't need to. `jump` for example only needs a single address. 

### Control Signals:
1 bit binary signals fed into the [[Control Unit]] so it can decide what do do next. 

### Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle Example:
(The <= means the thing on the left is set to the thing on the right at the end of a clock cycle)
1. Instruction fetch
   `IR < = Mem[PC]`
   `PC < = PC+4`

2. Instruction decode and register read
   `A < = Reg[IR[25:21]]`
   `B < = Reg[IR[20:16]]`
   `ALUOut < = PC+sgnext(IR[15:0]<<2)`

3a. R-type arithmetic/logical instruction
   `ALUOut < = A op B`

3b. Immediate arithmetic, including memory address generation
   `ALUOut < = A + sgnext(IR[15:0])`
3c. Branch completion
   `if (A = = B) PC < = ALUOut`

3d. Jump completion
   `PC < = {PC[31:28],IR[25:0],2’b00}` 

4a. R-type arithmetic-logical instruction completion
`Reg[IR[15:11]] < = ALUOut`

4b. Memory access (load)
`MDR < = Mem[ALUOut]`

4c. Memory access (store) & completion
`Mem[ALUOut] < = B`

5. Load Instruction Completion
`Red[IR[20:16]] < = MDR"

### Diagram + Example:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 11.43.14 a.m..png|350]]![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 11.44.41 a.m..png|350]]

> [!note] Idea
> The idea of combining small amounts of expensive but fast memory closer to the processor and larger amounts of cheaper but slower memory further from the processor. 

### Why does a hierarchy work so well?
Ask yourself: ""Why does using just a tiny bit of really fast memory make the computers incredibly quick?"". 2 reasons: *Temporal Locality* and *Spatial Locality*.

- ***Temporal Locality***: If a bit of memory has been accessed recently, it's likely to be used again soon. 
- ***Spacial Locality***: Memory locations close to a recently accessed memory location are likely to be used soon. 

> [!info] Why does this work so well?
> Without even intentionally doing this, we tend to write code that follows these paradigms. For example, think of a loop in [[(MIPS) Assembly Language]]. We have 3 consecutive instructions located consecutively in memory. The PC is at one and increments to get the next one (that's *right next to it*). And when you hit the jump in the loop? You go right back to the first one instruction, the one that's been recently used. Google hire expert coders that maximise locality in their algorithms to make their stuff even faster. 

### Who moves data between levels of hierarchy? Typically:
- *SW (compiler)*: Between registers and main memory (or [[Cache]]).
	- Think of `lw` and `sw`
- *HW*: Between caches and main memory. Typically programmers are not aware of caches.
	- As this goes between RAM <-> VRAM , it's typically done by the hardware and you don't even notice it happen. 
- *SW (Operating System)*: Between main memory and SSD.
	- This the bloke who's gotta"
Smurfing Attack.md,"Smurfing Attack.md

## What?
Remember that if you send something to [[IP Address]] ending with `.255`, it's a broadcast port. So if you send a ping it, everyone will respond to you saying they exist. But what if you sent a ping to it, pretending to be someone else? Then everyone will send *that* IP with a bunch of ping results. Boom. Genius. I know. It's called a *Reflection Attack*.

### Legit Use Cases:
- `ping 192.168.1.255` will cause everyone on that subnet to respond to you. (Ping carries forgeable information about where it's coming from.)
	- You could legitimately want to know who's on the subnet."
Binomial Distribution.md,"Binomial Distribution.md

### What:
In short, it describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials. Imagine flipping a coin (p=0.5) 5 times (n=5). The chances of getting all failures or all successes would fall onto one side of the distribution.  
The Binomial (Normal) Distribution is an incredibly popular one, characterised by it's unique bell-shaped curve (hence another name for it: Bell-Curve). 
### Theorem:
![[Screenshot 2023-11-08 at 2.16.46 p.m..png|600]]

### Looks like:
![[Screenshot 2023-11-08 at 2.21.49 p.m..png|404]]

Where n is the number of trials with a success probability p, x is the number of successes of X.



### Approximating Binomial Distribution
TODO: Not entirely understood."
Different Time Complexity Running Times.md,"Different Time Complexity Running Times.md

For an idea of the most common ones:
![[time-complexity-examples 1.png|200]]

### Linear: 
Like a single iteration over list $n$. 

### O(nLog(n))
Incredibly common. It's the [[Time Complexity]] of any algorithm that takes any input, splits it in 2 pieces and solves each piece recursively. EG [[Merge Sort]]. Another reason it's so common is because it's the time complexity of any algorithm who's most expensive step is the sorting of the input. 

### O(Log(n))
This happens when algorithm is doing a constant amount of work to throw away a constant fraction of the input. EG Famously [[Binary Search Algorithm]]."

### What is it:
This is a subteam of [[EUFS|EUFS]]. It's focused on analysing trends (in my time) on the self-driving landscape. You take this information and make presentations, namely:
- [[Real World Ai]]: presentations covering the real implications (positive and negative) of ML with self-driving cars. 
- [[Business Plan Presentation]]: Building a viable business product with the car that we're building
- [[World's Readiness for SAE Level 4]]


that's not so much focused on building or designing the cars or algorithms. Instead, you make presentations. The presenations differ between the DDT and [[Driverless (ADS)|ADS]] teams, but since I was more on the latter side, that's the one I'll focus on.  ^2f4667"
Tor 🧅.md,"Tor 🧅.md

## What?
- A *low-latency* protocol that uses *onion encryption[[Encryption|encryption]]*. All packets are constant sized. 
- ***Onion Encryption:***
	1. Client crafts a message. It's encrypted like an onion.
		- First encrypted with ***exit node's public key***. Since this wraps / encrypts the message, it's the inner-most layer.
		- Then encrypted with ***second node***.
		- Then encrypted with the ***entry node***. Thus, this layer is the outer most layer. 
	2. Client sends the message to the entry node. Entry node unwraps the outer-most-layer. 
	3. Entry-node forwards that to a middle node. Middle node unwraps the next layer. 
	4. Middle node forwards that to exit node. Exit node sends the traffic to the server. 
	- *Note: Look at the individual nodes and what they know. The exit knows what's the final destination. The entry node knows client is using Tor, but that's it. Middle node knows sweet fuck all lol.* 
 ![[Pasted image 20241027174510.png]]

### **Problems:** 
- ***Susceptible to Global Adversaries:*** If someone can see all of the traffic across the entire network, they can determine where your traffic is going. 

## Attacks:
- ***Time Correlation Attacks:*** 
	- Imagine you control the entry and exit node. 
	- You observe the traffic's timing and volume. 
	- You try and pair the entry's patterns to the exit's patterns. 
	- *Requires entry and exit node control. How would you have access? Maybe a selective DOS 😉*.
	- (Also applicable to [[Mixed Communication]])
	
- **End to End Correlation:** Basically the same, except you look at timing, volume, sequences (i.e. bursts, gaps etc..)
- ***Crypto tagging:*** 
	- Imagine we controlled both entry and exit node, and flipped a single [[(Computer) Bit|bit]] at the beginning.
	- When we decrypt the data at the exit node, the plain-text request may be slightly corrupted at the end. Thus we associate the entry and exit node.
	- Avoidable if using [[TCP-IP|HTTPS]].
- **Selective Denial of Service:** Image you own the first *""guard""* node, and an exit node. During the client's first establishing of the relay, you could keep dropping the connection until the relay randomly chooses your exit node. 
- **Website fingerprinting:** All websites' traffic looks slightly different. This could be a use of [[(Machine Learning) Models|machine learning]]. You could visit the top 100 most common websites, each a million times and then us ML to determine whether a specific visit is actually that website (the accuracy drops as the amount of websites being scanned rises). 
- ![[Pasted image 20241215184221.png|400]]

## Tor Hidden Services:
 In the giant image above, the servers are distinctly outside of the Tor Network. Tor Hidden Services is all about moving your servers inside the Tor Network. This anonymises the server. 
 
#### How?
 1. When the server comes online, it will randomly choose 3 normal nodes. These are known as ***Introduction Points***. 
 2. The server then makes (Tor) connections with the *Intro Point* (i.e. with 3 hops between). 
	 1. It tells these IPs: *""Hey! I want you to act as a gateway. Whenever someone comes looking for me, send their traffic to these already established channels.""*
	 2. It also publishes *""Descriptors""* to a distributed database.
		 1. It's basically a dictionary that says *""If you're looking for this `.onion` address, ask one of these Introductory Nodes""*
 3. A user will randomly choose a *""Rendezvous Node""* (and a new 3 hop connection is established between them). User then asks Node to send the *IntroPoint* a string *""secret""*. 
 4. The server will respond (via a new, fresh 3 hop relay) *to the Rendezvous Node* with a string secret. 
 5. The *Rendezvous Node* then bridges connection between client and server. In this version, there's ***6 hops*** between the client and server. Slow, but both are completely anonymous to everyone involved.
