    "## 1. The Convolutional Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional layer is like a double for loop ➿ over an image. At every location in the image 🖼️, it tries to detect some feature, like whether there is a vertical edge there, or if there's a blob of red 🟥, or if there's a square there or lots of other sorts of things. At the end, we get a new 'image' with big values where there is an edge, and smaller values where there isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does this using a *kernel*. The kernel of the convolution is the part that decides whether or not the feature is there. Really, the kernel is just another *tensor* (remember what a tensor is?). For grayscale images, we normally think of a kernel as being 2D, which is nice because they're easy to visualise! Generally, our kernels are square of size $n\\times n$, where we can decide how big they should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn why it's called a *convolution* from 3Blue1Brown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA). TLDR: It's a mathematical operation where you slide one set of numbers (.e.g. our image) over another (e.g. our *kernel*), cross-multiply and add up the results.\n",

And if you know where the nose and legs are, maybe you can tell where a face and a person is. Or you could tell which kind of animal is in the image. Or maybe you could detect where [cancerous cells in the brain are](https://github.com/adityajn105/brain-tumor-segmentation-unet).\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember last week we needed non-linearity of our input so as not to make straight lines? Some similar logic can be applied here, so we apply `ReLU` again. But now we have a much more intuitive reason for using ReLU: Imagine we have run a convolution layer that tries to detect where faces are. Each pixel in the output is a score for how confident we are there is a face at this location. Except, we only really care about the highest scores. Therefore, we can run the ReLU max function to only retain the information about where we are fairly sure there is a face. More theoretically, we represent far more complicated functions with ReLU.\n",

For example, if we try to detect faces, the convolutional layers in the base would find two circles next to each other (eyes), a vertical and a horizontal line (nose and mouth) and the dense layers in the head would learn to classify this combination of features as a face.\n",

This is where things get exciting: we’re going to take a dataset of satellite images and train a CNN to classify them into different categories. Satellite image classification is used in a ton of real-world applications. For example, in urban planning, satellite images help track how cities are expanding or where new infrastructure needs to be developed. In environmental monitoring, satellite image classification can help track deforestation 🌳, monitor crop health 🌾, or even assess the damage after natural disasters.\n",

You won't need to write a lot of code, but feel free to play around and change things.\n",

Making use of pre-trained models can be very helpful, and a lot of models are available for free directly within [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/hub/research-models). You can also check out [HuggingFace](www.huggingface.com), where people share a lot of datasets and pre-trained models that you can use. This comes in very handy if you are working on a project of your own and don't want to bother dealing with low-level details of the CNN-architecture.\n",
